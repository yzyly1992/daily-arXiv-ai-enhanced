However, current methods often rely\non large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.\nFirst-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks\nflexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based\nLoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video\n(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background\nregions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers\nefficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.\nTo better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as\nalternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual\nanchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a\nmask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model\nto the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the\ninput video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images\noffer appearance guidance.

Recent methods have introduced guidance\nvia diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we\nextend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable\nPrompt-Aware R\\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for\nprompt-aware diversity guidance.

In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based\nadversarial attack methods have been studied.

Current\nresearch on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in\nfully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability\nof the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping\nthe image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image\ninto blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various\ntransformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input\ndiversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting\nintermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the\namplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial\nexamples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the\nauxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the\ntrue class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by\nthe proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on\ntwo public HSI datasets.

While CLIP is capable of making image\nfeatures to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap\nremains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.\nUsing multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel\nmethod, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text\ncaptions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained\ntext-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images\nfrom text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,\nT2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This\naggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual\nfeatures more robust and informative for multi-label recognition.
