### [2] [LoRA-Edit: Controllable First-Frame-Guided Video Editing via Mask-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10082)
*Chenjian Gao,Lihe Ding,Xin Cai,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mask-based LoRA tuning method for flexible video editing using pretrained image-to-video diffusion models, preserving backgrounds and enabling controlled edits propagation guided by multiple visual references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods using diffusion models rely heavily on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits and lacking control over frames beyond the first.

Method: A mask-driven LoRA tuning approach adapts pretrained Image-to-Video models for region-specific learning by combining spatial structure from the input video and appearance guidance from reference images, using spatial masks to control attention dynamically without changing the model architecture.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that their method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in flexible and high-quality video editing, enabling efficient editing without compromising background preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed mask-based LoRA tuning enables adaptable and precise video editing by effectively integrating multiple visual references and preserving scene consistency, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [3] [DeepTraverse: A Depth-First Search Inspired Network for Algorithmic Visual Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10084)
*Bin Guo,John H. L. Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepTraverse is a vision architecture inspired by classical search algorithms, enabling adaptive and iterative feature refinement, achieving competitive image classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional vision backbones use uniform operations offering limited adaptive, structured refinement and lack interpretable reasoning-like processes.

Method: DeepTraverse introduces recursive exploration modules for deep feature analysis with parameter sharing and adaptive calibration modules to adjust feature salience dynamically based on global context.

Result: It achieves highly competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often outperforming conventional models with similar or more parameters.

Conclusion: Incorporating algorithmic search principles results in more efficient, interpretable, and high-performing vision backbone architectures.

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

### [4] [Test-Time Adaptation for Generalizable Task Progress Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10085)
*Christos Ziakas,Alessandra Russo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a test-time adaptation method for progress estimation models that improves their ability to adapt to new visual and temporal contexts using a meta-learned self-supervised objective, outperforming existing methods generalizing across diverse tasks and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the adaptability of progress estimation models to varied and out-of-distribution test environments by leveraging both visual and temporal context through self-supervised learning.

Method: A gradient-based meta-learning approach is used to train the model on expert visual trajectories paired with natural language tasks, enabling it to optimize a self-supervised objective at test time for better semantic and temporal understanding.

Result: The proposed method generalizes well from limited training environments to diverse unseen tasks, environments, and embodiments, surpassing state-of-the-art in-context learning techniques with autoregressive vision-language models.

Conclusion: Test-time adaptation with meta-learned self-supervision significantly enhances progress estimation models' performance and generalization across different scenarios beyond traditional in-context learning.

Abstract: We propose a test-time adaptation method that enables a progress estimation
model to adapt online to the visual and temporal context of test trajectories
by optimizing a learned self-supervised objective. To this end, we introduce a
gradient-based meta-learning strategy to train the model on expert visual
trajectories and their natural language task descriptions, such that test-time
adaptation improves progress estimation relying on semantic content over
temporal order. Our test-time adaptation method generalizes from a single
training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and
embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art in-context learning approach
using autoregressive vision-language models.

### [5] [EfficientVLA: Training-Free Acceleration and Compression for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10100)
*Yantai Yang,Yuhao Wang,Zichen Wen,Luo Zhongwei,Chang Zou,Zhipeng Zhang,Chuan Wen,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientVLA is an inference acceleration framework for Vision-Language-Action models that reduces computation and memory usage by exploiting redundancies, achieving nearly double speed with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models, especially diffusion-based ones, have high computational and memory costs, hindering their practical use because existing acceleration techniques address only isolated inefficiencies.

Method: EfficientVLA uses three strategies: pruning redundant language module layers, selecting a compact set of visual tokens to optimize visual processing, and caching intermediate features in the diffusion action head to reduce temporal redundancy.

Result: Applying EfficientVLA to CogACT model achieved a 1.93X speedup, reduced FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% drop in success rate on the SIMPLER benchmark.

Conclusion: Holistically addressing multiple redundancies across the VLA pipeline through a structured, training-free framework can significantly accelerate inference with minimal impact on performance, improving practical deployability of VLA systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

### [6] [A Manually Annotated Image-Caption Dataset for Detecting Children in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10117)
*Klim Kireev,Ana-Maria Creţu,Raphael Meier,Sarah Adel Bargal,Elissa Redmiles,Carmela Troncoso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD) to benchmark detection of content depicting minors in images with captions, addressing a gap in multi-modal child detection datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of datasets and benchmarks for detecting digital content of minors in multi-modal settings despite regulatory needs and widespread use of automated detection tools.

Method: The authors created ICCWD, a dataset of 10,000 manually labeled image-caption pairs representing children in diverse contexts, and benchmarked three detection methods including a commercial age estimator.

Result: Benchmarking shows child detection remains challenging, with the best method achieving only a 75.3% true positive rate, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: Releasing ICCWD will facilitate development of improved automated detection tools for minors across varied scenarios, supporting regulatory and platform needs.

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

*Natanael Lucena,Fábio S. da Silva,Ricardo Rios*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study compares CNNs and Vision Transformers for multi-class classification of psoriasis-related images, finding ViTs, especially DaViT-B, outperform CNNs with higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the most effective deep learning architecture for automated classification of psoriasis and similar skin lesions.

Method: Evaluated ImageNet pre-trained CNNs and Vision Transformers on a specific psoriasis lesion dataset, comparing predictive performance metrics.

Result: ViTs, notably DaViT-B, achieved superior predictive accuracy with an f1-score of 96.4%, outperforming CNNs.

Conclusion: Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base is recommended for efficient and accurate automated psoriasis detection, highlighting ViTs' potential in medical image classification.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in the task of multi-classifying
images containing lesions of psoriasis and diseases similar to it. Models
pre-trained on ImageNet were adapted to a specific data set. Both achieved high
predictive metrics, but the ViTs stood out for their superior performance with
smaller models. Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base (DaViT-B) obtained the
best results, with an f1-score of 96.4%, and is recommended as the most
efficient architecture for automated psoriasis detection. This article
reinforces the potential of ViTs for medical image classification tasks.

### [8] [ViCrit: A Verifiable Reinforcement Learning Proxy Task for Visual Perception in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10128)
*Xiyao Wang,Zhengyuan Yang,Chao Feng,Yongyuan Liang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiaoyu Liu,Ziyi Zang,Ming Li,Chung-Ching Lin,Kevin Lin,Linjie Li,Furong Huang,Lijuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ViCrit, a reinforcement learning task for vision-language models that detects subtle synthetic errors in image captions, improving visual perception capabilities across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL fine-tuning in language models is effective for tasks like math and code but lacks vision-centric, challenging yet verifiable tasks for vision-language models.

Method: ViCrit injects one subtle visual hallucination error in human-written image captions and trains models to locate the corrupted span given the image and modified caption, using a clear binary reward.

Result: Models trained with ViCrit showed significant improvement on various vision-language benchmarks, including natural images, abstract reasoning, and visual math tasks, indicating better visual perception rather than memorization.

Conclusion: Fine-grained hallucination criticism via the ViCrit task is an effective, generalizable RL objective to enhance vision-language models' visual perception, supported by the new ViCrit-Bench evaluation benchmark.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

### [9] [RoCA: Robust Cross-Domain End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10145)
*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hsin-Pai Cheng,Litian Liu,Shweta Mahajan,Apratim Bhattacharyya,Yunxiao Shi,Risheek Garrepalli,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoCA is a framework designed to improve end-to-end autonomous driving across domains by probabilistically modeling driving scenarios for better generalization and adaptation without heavy retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E autonomous driving models struggle with cross-domain deployment and costly domain adaptation. Incorporating LLMs has limitations in performance consistency and retraining cost.

Method: RoCA formulates a joint probabilistic distribution of ego and surrounding vehicle information using Gaussian processes to learn basis tokens and trajectories representing diverse driving scenarios. It integrates with base E2E models to enhance generalizability and allows robust adaptation to new domains.

Result: RoCA improves the generalization of E2E models in source domains without extra inference cost and significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning when adapting to new target domains, demonstrating strong cross-domain driving performance.

Conclusion: RoCA provides an effective solution for robust cross-domain end-to-end autonomous driving, enabling better generalization and adaptation across diverse driving environments without prohibitive retraining.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

### [10] [SPARKE: Scalable Prompt-Aware Diversity Guidance in Diffusion Models via RKE Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10173)
*Mohammad Jalali,Haoyu Lei,Amin Gohari,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPARKE, a method to enhance prompt-aware diversity in text-to-image diffusion models by using conditional entropy for diversity guidance, reducing computational complexity and improving sample variety across semantic prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring adequate diversity in generated samples from prompt-guided diffusion models is challenging, especially when prompts vary widely semantically and diversity needs to be measured in a prompt-aware manner.

Method: They propose SPARKE, which uses conditional entropy-based diversity guidance dynamically conditioned on similar prompts. They specifically use Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance to reduce entropy computation complexity from O(n³) to O(n), enabling efficient large-scale diversity-guided sampling.

Result: SPARKE improves prompt-aware diversity of generated images across various text-to-image diffusion models without significant computational overhead, enabling diversity-guided sampling over thousands of prompt variations.

Conclusion: SPARKE effectively enhances prompt-aware diversity in generative diffusion models with scalable entropy-based guidance, addressing computational challenges and improving diverse generation quality at scale.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

### [11] [Retrieval of Surface Solar Radiation through Implicit Albedo Recovery from Temporal Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10174)
*Yael Frischholz,Devis Tuia,Michael Lehning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an attention-based model using a Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer to improve surface solar radiation retrieval from satellite images, especially in mountainous regions with complex snow cover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating clear-sky background reflectance rely on monthly statistics that fail in regions with dynamic snow cover, such as mountainous areas, leading to inaccurate SSR retrieval.

Method: The authors introduce an attention-based emulator trained on satellite image sequences and static features, eliminating the need for handcrafted features like albedo maps or cloud masks, leveraging multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery and topographic data.

Result: The model performs comparable to albedo-informed methods by learning latent surface reflectance dynamics internally, particularly excelling in complex mountainous terrain, and improves generalization across different topographic conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively captures surface reflectance variability without explicit albedo input, enhancing SSR retrieval accuracy in difficult mountainous environments; code and data are publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at
https://github.com/frischwood/HeMu-dev.git

### [12] [Attention, Please! Revisiting Attentive Probing for Masked Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10178)
*Bill Psomas,Dionysis Christopoulos,Eirini Baltzi,Ioannis Kakogeorgiou,Tilemachos Aravanis,Nikos Komodakis,Konstantinos Karantzalos,Yannis Avrithis,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Efficient Probing (EP), a streamlined attentive probing technique for evaluating self-supervised learning models trained with Masked Image Modeling. EP reduces parameterization and improves computational efficiency by using multi-query cross-attention, outperforming standard linear probing and prior attentive methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard linear probing does not capture the full potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling due to distributed patch tokens, while current attentive probing methods are overly complex and inefficient.

Method: The authors analyze existing attentive probing methods and propose Efficient Probing (EP), which employs a multi-query cross-attention mechanism to reduce redundant computations and parameters, achieving a significant speed-up.

Result: EP outperforms linear probing and previous attentive probing approaches across seven benchmarks, exhibits better generalization to diverse pre-training paradigms, offers interpretable attention maps, and shows strong performance in low-shot and layer-wise evaluations.

Conclusion: Efficient Probing provides a practical, efficient, and effective alternative to linear probing for evaluating self-supervised learning models, enabling better utilization of Masked Image Modeling representations with superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

### [13] [Improving Personalized Search with Regularized Low-Rank Parameter Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10182)
*Fiona Ryan,Josef Sivic,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Judy Hoffman,James M. Rehg,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for personalized vision-language retrieval that adapts a vision-language dual encoder model to learn new personal concepts from few examples while preserving general knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task requires recognizing new personal concepts from limited examples while integrating these with general knowledge for accurate retrieval across contexts, a challenging balance to achieve.

Method: A regularized low-rank adaptation of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer is proposed, serving as an effective alternative to textual inversion. Additionally, parameter addition is explored for combining multiple personal concepts. A new metric based on captions from a vision-language model evaluates how well general knowledge is preserved.

Result: The approach outperforms prior methods by 4%-22% on personalized image retrieval tasks in two benchmark datasets, DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi, demonstrating improved accuracy on personal retrieval queries.

Conclusion: Regularized low-rank adaptation of language encoder parameters, combined with parameter addition for multiple concepts, effectively balances learning new personal concepts with preserving general knowledge, leading to superior personalized vision-language retrieval performance.

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

### [14] [ScoreMix: Improving Face Recognition via Score Composition in Diffusion Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10226)
*Parsa Rahimi,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScoreMix is a novel data augmentation method that mixes diffusion model scores from different class conditions to create challenging synthetic samples, improving discriminator performance especially with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of discriminators in scenarios with limited labeled data by using synthetic samples generated through diffusion models.

Method: Convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned diffusion trajectories to generate synthetic samples, investigating class-selection strategies based on the discriminator's embedding space rather than the generator's condition space.

Result: Significant improvements in discriminator capabilities across multiple benchmarks, with greater gains when mixing classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space, and minimal correlation found between generator and discriminator spaces.

Conclusion: ScoreMix effectively improves discriminative model training with limited data without extensive parameter tuning, offering a practical data augmentation strategy leveraging diffusion model score compositionality.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

*Hamid Kamangir,Mona Hajiesmaeeli,Mason Earles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a benchmark dataset and deep learning model for forecasting crop yields across California, integrating diverse data sources for improved prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and timely crop yield forecasting is challenging due to the complex influence of environmental, climatic, and soil factors despite extensive historical data.

Method: The study compiles a benchmark dataset from multiple sources (satellite imagery, climate records, soil properties) covering 70+ crops and develops a multi-modal deep learning model with stratified feature extraction and timeseries encoding for county-level, crop-specific predictions.

Result: The model achieved an overall R2 score of 0.76 on unseen test data, demonstrating strong predictive performance across diverse California agricultural regions.

Conclusion: The benchmark dataset and modeling framework provide a solid foundation for improving agricultural forecasting, aiding climate adaptation and precision farming; all resources are openly shared for community use.

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at
our GitHub repository.

### [16] [DySS: Dynamic Queries and State-Space Learning for Efficient 3D Object Detection from Multi-Camera Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10242)
*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DySS is a novel camera-based 3D object detection method for autonomous driving that uses state-space learning and dynamic queries to efficiently and effectively process features over time, outperforming previous methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BEV 3D object detection methods are either costly due to dense feature construction or inefficient with large query sets in query-based approaches, especially over long video sequences.

Method: DySS applies a state-space model to sequentially process features with auxiliary tasks—future prediction and masked reconstruction—to better capture motion and correspondence. It dynamically updates detection queries through merge, remove, and split operations to maintain an efficient set of queries.

Result: DySS achieves superior detection results on the nuScenes dataset (65.31 NDS, 57.4 mAP on test split) and real-time inference speed (33 FPS) on the validation split, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The integration of state-space learning with dynamic query management in DySS leads to more effective and efficient 3D object detection in BEV, benefiting autonomous driving applications with improved accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

*Eunkyu Park,Minyeong Kim,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HalLoc is a new dataset and model for detecting hallucinations in vision-language models efficiently and probabilistically, aiding reliable real-world use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in vision-language models reduce reliability, and existing detection methods are resource-intensive and inflexible, hindering practical deployment.

Method: They created HalLoc, a 150K token-level annotated dataset covering VQA, instruction-following, and image captioning with graded hallucination labels, and developed a baseline model for low-overhead, concurrent detection.

Result: The model detects hallucinations with probabilistic confidence, integrates easily with existing models, and improves reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

Conclusion: HalLoc enables efficient, confidence-aware hallucination detection, offering a plug-and-play solution to enhance vision-language model trustworthiness in practical applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

*Hamzeh Asgharnezhad,Pegah Tabarisaadi,Abbas Khosravi,Roohallah Alizadehsani,U. Rajendra Acharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates deep learning models for skin cancer classification using transfer learning and uncertainty quantification on the HAM10000 dataset. CLIP-based models combined with SVM perform best, and ensemble methods improve uncertainty handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve skin cancer diagnosis accuracy and reliability by addressing data scarcity and enhancing uncertainty awareness in deep learning models.

Method: Benchmarking pre-trained feature extractors with traditional classifiers, incorporating uncertainty quantification methods like Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout, and evaluating with uncertainty-aware metrics.

Result: CLIP-based vision transformers with SVM deliver the highest classification accuracy; ensemble methods balance accuracy and uncertainty well, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty quantification into deep learning models improves both the performance and trustworthiness of automated skin cancer diagnosis in clinical settings.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

*Sadia Kamal,Tim Oates,Joy Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a weakly supervised multimodal framework for generating structured clinical SOAP notes from lesion images and sparse clinical text, reducing manual annotation needs and clinician burden while maintaining high clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual generation of detailed SOAP notes in clinical settings is labor-intensive, contributes to clinician burnout, and relies heavily on extensive annotations, which limits scalability.

Method: The authors propose a weakly supervised multimodal approach that utilizes limited inputs—lesion images and sparse clinical text—to automatically generate clinically structured SOAP notes without requiring large annotated datasets.

Result: The proposed method achieves performance on par with leading AI systems like GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro based on key clinical relevance metrics. Additionally, two new evaluation metrics, MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS), were introduced to measure semantic alignment and coherence with expert medical concepts and input features.

Conclusion: This framework effectively produces high-quality clinical documentation while reducing annotation requirements and clinician workload, offering a scalable solution for clinically grounded SOAP note generation.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

*Fei Zhao,Da Pan,Zelu Qi,Ping Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limited study on audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) for user-generated omnidirectional videos (ODVs) by creating a dataset and developing a baseline model that performs well on it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the rising interest in Metaverse-related omnidirectional videos and the lack of AVQA research, particularly for user-generated content, ensuring better quality evaluation is needed.

Method: They built a UGC ODV A/V dataset with 300 videos from 10 scenes using 2 camera types, conducted subjective quality tests to get MOS, then created a baseline AVQA model with separate audio and video feature extraction and fusion modules.

Result: The proposed baseline AVQA model achieved optimal performance on the newly created dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Providing this dataset and baseline model advances research in UGC-ODV AVQA, facilitating quality assessment for omnidirectional audio-visual content in Metaverse applications.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

### [21] [Using Vision Language Models to Detect Students' Academic Emotion through Facial Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10334)
*Deliang Wang,Chao Yang,Gaowei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to analyze students' academic emotions from facial expressions without requiring model fine-tuning. Two VLMs were tested on images representing various emotions, showing moderate success, particularly in recognizing happy and confused expressions, but poor performance in detecting distracted behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised machine learning models for analyzing students' academic emotions require extensive data collection and training and often fail to generalize across different contexts. The emergence of Vision-Language Models offers a potential zero-shot approach to overcome these limitations.

Method: The study used two Vision-Language Models, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000 images of students' facial expressions indicating emotions like confusion, distraction, happiness, neutrality, and tiredness using zero-shot prompting without model fine-tuning.

Result: Both models achieved moderate performance in recognizing academic facial expressions. Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperformed Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct overall, especially excelling at identifying happy and confused emotions, while both struggled to detect distracted behavior.

Conclusion: Vision-Language Models show promise for analyzing students' academic emotions from facial expressions in online learning environments using zero-shot prompting. Particularly, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct's ability to recognize confusion highlights its potential for practical applications in improving educational content based on student emotional feedback.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

### [22] [PointGS: Point Attention-Aware Sparse View Synthesis with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10335)
*Lintao Xiang,Hongpei Zheng,Yating Huang,Qijun Yang,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a Point-wise Feature-Aware Gaussian Splatting framework for 3D scene rendering that improves quality and speed from sparse views by leveraging stereo models, self-attention networks, and multiscale 2D features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods require many calibrated views for consistent 3D scene representation and overfit when views are sparse, reducing rendering quality.

Method: The method uses stereo foundation models for accurate camera pose and dense point cloud generation, encodes Gaussian colors by aggregating multiscale 2D features, and applies a point interaction network with self-attention to enhance appearance representation, decoded via MLPs for rendering.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvements over NeRF-based methods and strong results under few-shot conditions compared to state-of-the-art 3DGS techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the sparse view limitation in 3DGS, enabling real-time, high-quality rendering with fewer input views, outperforming existing methods in quality and speed.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

### [23] [GeoCAD: Local Geometry-Controllable CAD Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10337)
*Zhanwei Zhang,Kaiyuan Liu,Junjie Liu,Wenxiao Wang,Binbin Lin,Liang Xie,Chen Shen,Deng Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoCAD is a novel method for local geometry-controllable CAD generation that automatically modifies local parts of CAD models according to user-specific geometric instructions and leverages large language models for improved control and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD generation methods either cannot follow textual geometric instructions or fail to focus on local parts, limiting their usefulness in efficient and precise local modifications.

Method: GeoCAD employs a complementary captioning strategy combining vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning to annotate various local parts with geometric instructions, then trains a model by masking local parts and predicting them using large language models conditioned on geometric instructions and remaining parts.

Result: GeoCAD captions around 221k local parts and demonstrates superior performance in generation quality, validity, and adherence to user-specified geometric instructions in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: GeoCAD effectively enables user-friendly, local geometry-controllable CAD generation, improving design efficiency and accuracy in modifying local CAD model parts.

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

*Jun Yin,Jing Zhong,Peilin Li,Pengyu Zeng,Miao Zhang,Ran Luo,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-language model-based framework to analyze urban streetscape styles, using a new dataset and demonstrating the model's effectiveness in capturing subtle style differences between cities and historical periods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional urban cultural studies that rely on expert interpretation and historical documentation, which are hard to standardize and scale across different urban contexts.

Method: They construct UrbanDiffBench, a dataset of urban streetscape images from various periods and locations, and develop UrbanSense, a vision-language-model-based framework to quantitatively generate and compare urban style representations via automated analysis.

Result: The method achieved over 80% statistical significance in generated style descriptions and received high subjective evaluation scores (Phi scores of 0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods), indicating strong capability to capture subtle stylistic differences across urban environments.

Conclusion: The proposed vision-language framework provides an objective, scalable, and data-driven tool for analyzing urban streetscape styles, offering a scientifically grounded perspective to study and anticipate urban cultural and architectural evolution.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

### [25] [RealKeyMorph: Keypoints in Real-world Coordinates for Resolution-agnostic Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10344)
*Mina C. Moghadam,Alan Q. Wang,Omer Taub,Martin R. Prince,Mert R. Sabuncu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RealKeyMorph (RKM) is a resolution-agnostic image registration method that avoids resampling artifacts by working directly with real-world coordinates from scanner data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning-based image registration methods resample images to a fixed resolution, which can introduce interpolation artifacts, particularly problematic when images differ in spatial resolution due to acquisition parameters.

Method: RKM extends KeyMorph by training a network to learn corresponding keypoints and outputting these keypoints in real-world scanner coordinates using the affine matrix from the scanner, thus avoiding the need for image resampling and enabling resolution-agnostic registration.

Result: Experiments on abdominal MRI 2D slices and 3D brain volumes with varying resolutions demonstrate that RKM effectively registers images without the artifacts introduced by resampling.

Conclusion: RKM successfully overcomes the limitations of fixed-resolution resampling in image registration by leveraging real-world coordinate transformations, improving registration across images of differing resolutions.

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-R1 enhances text-to-motion generation by integrating a Chain-of-Thought mechanism for decomposing complex instructions, improving controllability, consistency, and diversity in generated motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-motion approaches struggle with capturing deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning, leading to generated motions that lack controllability, consistency, and diversity.

Method: Motion-R1 introduces a Chain-of-Thought mechanism to decompose complex textual instructions into structured action paths, combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm optimizing reasoning chains and motion synthesis.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, especially in handling nuanced semantic understanding and maintaining long-term temporal coherence.

Conclusion: Integrating explicit logical decomposition via Chain-of-Thought and reinforcement learning optimization significantly improves the interpretability and quality of text-to-motion generation, enabling better execution of multi-step and compositionally rich commands.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper proposes FSATFusion, a novel infrared and visible image fusion network using frequency-spatial attention Transformers to better capture global context and features, outperforming existing methods in fusion quality, efficiency, and generalization to other tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing convolutional neural network based approaches for infrared and visible image fusion have limited ability to capture global context, leading to information loss and restricting fusion performance.

Result: Experiments show FSATFusion achieves superior fusion quality and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, generalizes well to two additional tasks without modification, and outperforms others in object detection downstream tasks.

Conclusion: FSATFusion effectively addresses limitations of convolution-based fusion by leveraging frequency-spatial attention Transformers, resulting in enhanced fusion performance and strong generalization for various visual tasks.

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

### [29] [Revisiting Transformers with Insights from Image Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10371)
*Laziz U. Abdullaev,Maksim Tkachenko,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a unifying image processing framework to interpret the self-attention mechanism in Transformers, explaining core components like positional encoding and residual connections, and introduces architectural modifications that improve both interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current understanding of self-attention mechanisms in Transformers is largely heuristic and lacks a deep mechanistic interpretation, especially regarding enhancements like positional encoding and residual connections.

Method: Develop a unifying framework based on image processing concepts to explain self-attention and its components; introduce two architectural modifications inspired by this framework.

Result: The proposed modifications not only enhance interpretability but also improve accuracy, robustness to data contamination and adversarial attacks, and long sequence understanding across both language and vision tasks.

Conclusion: The image processing framework successfully clarifies the inner workings of self-attention and its variants, bridging conceptual gaps and offering practical architectural improvements with empirical benefits.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

### [30] [Leveraging 6DoF Pose Foundation Models For Mapping Marine Sediment Burial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10386)
*Jerry Yan,Chinmay Talegaonkar,Nicholas Antipa,Eric Terrill,Sophia Merrifield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseIDON uses deep learning and photogrammetry to estimate object poses and burial depths on the seafloor from ROV video, achieving about 10 cm accuracy, aiding environmental monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding burial states of anthropogenic seafloor objects is important for ecological risk assessment and remediation, but remote burial depth estimation is challenging due to visibility and occlusion issues.

Method: PoseIDON combines deep foundation model features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate 6-DOF object pose and seafloor orientation, aligning CAD models to imagery and fitting local seafloor planes to infer burial depths.

Result: Validated on 54 objects including barrels and munitions, PoseIDON achieves around 10 cm mean burial depth error and detects spatial burial patterns linked to sediment transport.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, non-invasive way to map seafloor burial states, supporting environmental assessments and mitigation planning at contaminated ocean sites.

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

### [31] [DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Transformer and Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390)
*Shicheng Yin,Kaixuan Yin,Yang Liu,Weixing Chen,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), a technique that adaptively partitions images into variable-sized patches, improving vision transformers by focusing more tokens on important regions, enhancing accuracy while reducing computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-size patches in vision transformers often waste resources on background and lose fine details in sparse informative regions.

Method: DART uses learnable region scores and differentiable quantile operations to dynamically allocate denser tokens to content-rich areas, adding minimal extra parameters.

Result: DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT with 45% less FLOPs, consistently enhancing performance on multiple models with minimal or reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: Adaptive region partitioning via DART is an efficient and effective alternative to uniform token density increase, improving vision transformer performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

### [32] [ReconMOST: Multi-Layer Sea Temperature Reconstruction with Observations-Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10391)
*Yuanyi Song,Pumeng Lyu,Ben Fei,Fenghua Ling,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReconMOST, a diffusion model-based framework for reconstructing multi-layer ocean temperature fields globally from sparse observational data, outperforming traditional and ML methods in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate ocean temperature reconstruction is critical for climate studies and marine meteorology but is challenged by sparse data, complex algorithms, and high computational cost. Existing ML methods are limited to surface or local reconstructions and struggle with data gaps like cloud occlusion.

Method: ReconMOST pre-trains an unconditional diffusion model on extensive historical numerical simulations to learn physically consistent ocean temperature patterns. It then uses sparse, accurate in-situ data as guidance during reverse diffusion to reconstruct global, multi-layer temperature fields, implicitly filling missing regions with physically plausible patterns.

Result: ReconMOST handled over 92.5% missing data while maintaining high accuracy and spatial resolution. Tested on CMIP6 and EN4 datasets, it achieved low mean squared errors (0.049 on guidance data and about 0.68 on reconstruction), demonstrating robustness and superior generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed ReconMOST framework effectively extends machine learning-based sea temperature reconstruction from local and surface levels to global multi-layer scales, addressing data sparsity and improving reconstruction quality, making it valuable for climate and marine research.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pisces is a new multimodal foundation model that excels in both image understanding and generation by using separate visual encoders and tailored training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified multimodal models often underperform compared to specialized models due to differing visual features and training requirements for image understanding and generation.

Method: Pisces employs a decoupled visual encoding architecture, tailored training techniques, and meticulous data curation to optimize performance for both tasks.

Result: Pisces achieves competitive performance on over 20 image understanding benchmarks and shows strong generative ability on the GenEval image generation benchmark.

Conclusion: Using separate visual encoders and specialized training enables unified models like Pisces to effectively combine image understanding and generation, advancing multimodal model development.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

*Guoyi Zhang,Guangsheng Xu,Siyang Chen,Han Wang,Xiaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRRNet is a novel end-to-end deep learning framework for infrared small target detection that models low-rank backgrounds directly, outperforming 38 methods with real-time speed and robustness to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection is challenging due to low signal-to-clutter ratios, diverse target shapes, and lack of clear visual features, causing unstable performance in existing deep learning approaches.

Method: The paper introduces LRRNet, which exploits the low-rank property of infrared backgrounds via a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm. It models structure-aware low-rank representations in the image domain directly with deep neural networks, avoiding patch-based methods or explicit matrix decomposition.

Result: Experiments on multiple public datasets show LRRNet surpasses 38 state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, achieving an average speed of 82.34 FPS. It also performs well on the noisy NoisySIRST dataset, showing resilience to sensor noise.

Conclusion: LRRNet effectively leverages low-rank background structures in an end-to-end deep learning framework, delivering superior infrared small target detection accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

### [35] [MF2Summ: Multimodal Fusion for Video Summarization with Temporal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10430)
*Shuo wang,Jihao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MF2Summ is a multimodal video summarization model integrating visual and auditory data through a five-stage process, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video summarization methods using single modality fail to capture full semantic richness of videos, necessitating multimodal approaches.

Method: MF2Summ extracts visual features with GoogLeNet, auditory features with SoundNet, and fuses them via cross-modal and self-attention Transformers to model inter-modal and temporal dependencies, followed by segment prediction and key shot selection using NMS and KTS.

Result: On SumMe and TVSum datasets, MF2Summ improved F1-scores by 1.9% and 0.6% respectively over DSNet, showing competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal content via advanced attention mechanisms effectively enhances video summarization, making MF2Summ a robust and competitive method.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

### [36] [Towards Robust Multimodal Emotion Recognition under Missing Modalities and Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10452)
*Guowei Zhong,Ruohong Huan,Mingzhen Wu,Ronghua Liang,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CIDer, a robust framework for multimodal emotion recognition that addresses modality missing and out-of-distribution challenges using self-distillation and causal inference, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing MER methods that struggle with simultaneous modality missing and OOD data handling, and often require complex, model-specific architectures with many parameters.

Method: CIDer combines a Model-Specific Self-Distillation module that enhances robustness via shared weight distillation across features and attention maps, and a Model-Agnostic Causal Inference module that uses causal graphs and counterfactual texts to reduce biases, complemented by a Word-level Self-aligned Attention Module and Multimodal Composite Transformer for efficient fusion.

Result: CIDer demonstrated robust performance on newly repartitioned MER OOD datasets under the Random Modality Feature Missing task, achieving faster training, fewer parameters, and superior OOD generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CIDer provides a practical, efficient, and effective solution to handle both modality missing and OOD challenges in MER, advancing the robustness and generalization of emotion recognition systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

### [37] [Rethinking Generative Human Video Coding with Implicit Motion Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10453)
*Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Jie Chen,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Implicit Motion Transformation (IMT) method to improve generative human body video coding (GHVC), addressing limitations of explicit motion guidance seen in complex human body videos, leading to higher compression efficiency and better video reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human body videos have more complex and diverse motion than facial videos, causing explicit motion-based generative video codec methods to produce distortions and inaccuracies in reconstruction.

Method: The paper introduces Implicit Motion Transformation (IMT), which encodes human body video signals into compact visual features and uses these as implicit motion guidance to reconstruct high-quality video signals.

Result: Experimental results show that IMT enhances GHVC performance by enabling more efficient compression and producing higher fidelity synthesized video.

Conclusion: Implicit motion-based approaches like IMT can overcome limitations of explicit motion methods, effectively improving generative human body video compression and reconstruction.

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

*Chun Liu,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zheng Zheng,Zheng Li,Wei Yang,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method to improve the transferability of adversarial attacks on hyperspectral image classification, using block-wise transformations and a feature distancing loss to better disrupt model features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) differ from natural images and existing adversarial attack methods struggle to fully exploit their structural and spectral features, limiting transferability and attack effectiveness.

Method: The method involves randomly dividing HSIs into spatial and spectral blocks, applying diverse transformations to increase input diversity, and designing a feature distancing loss based on intermediate layers to guide perturbations that disrupt true class features, enhancing transferability.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed adversarial examples transfer effectively to black-box models and remain robust against defense strategies on two public HSI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances the transferability and robustness of adversarial attacks on HSI classification models by leveraging block-wise input diversity and feature-level loss, addressing challenges unique to HSIs.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

*Stone Yun,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how different weight initialization methods affect the quantization robustness of CNNs and introduces Graph Hypernetworks (GHNs) as a novel quantization-robust weight initialization, improving low-bit quantized model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited prior work has explored improving DNN training initial conditions to enhance quantization robustness, despite known impacts of weight initialization on floating point models.

Method: The study examines various random weight initializers on CNN components and proposes using GHNs to predict quantized model weights. It fine-tunes GHNs (GHN-QAT) for quantized graphs to further boost accuracy.

Result: GHN-predicted weights show strong quantization robustness after float32 pretraining, and GHN-QAT notably improves quantized CNN accuracy, especially at 4-bit and 2-bit precision levels, outperforming random initialization.

Conclusion: Weight initialization significantly impacts quantization robustness in CNNs; GHN-QAT is a promising approach to improve quantized DNN design, with potential to enhance quantization-aware training and streamline quantization workflows.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework for generating precise medical image segmentation masks based on complex and implicit medical instructions using multimodal large language models. It introduces a novel task, medical image reasoning segmentation, and a new dataset, MedSeg-QA, to support this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation methods rely heavily on explicit human instructions and lack active reasoning abilities to understand complex clinical questions, limiting their effectiveness in automatic diagnosis.

Method: MedSeg-R uses a global context understanding module to interpret images and complex medical instructions, creating multimodal intermediate tokens, and a pixel-level grounding module to decode these tokens into precise segmentation masks and textual responses. The paper also introduces MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset with image-mask pairs and multi-turn conversations, annotated and reviewed by physicians.

Result: MedSeg-R demonstrates superior performance on multiple benchmarks, achieving high segmentation accuracy and providing interpretable textual analysis of medical images.

Conclusion: The proposed MedSeg-R effectively addresses the challenge of medical image reasoning segmentation, advancing automatic medical diagnosis by integrating reasoning capabilities with precise image segmentation guided by complex medical questions.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical
images.

Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting sophisticated deepfakes and explore whether emerging vision-language models can effectively perform zero-shot deepfake detection.

Method: Structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs on a benchmark dataset containing authentic and manipulated images across three deepfake categories; measuring classification accuracy and reasoning capabilities.

Result: VLMs produce coherent explanations and can detect surface anomalies but fail as standalone detectors due to overemphasis on stylistic cues and susceptibility to misleading patterns like vintage aesthetics; however, they excel in interpretability and contextual reasoning.

Conclusion: While general-purpose VLMs lack autonomous reliability for deepfake detection, their interpretability and reasoning strengths make them valuable for supporting human experts in hybrid detection frameworks.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

### [42] [Sheet Music Benchmark: Standardized Optical Music Recognition Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10488)
*Juan C. Martinez-Sevilla,Joan Cerveto-Serrano,Noelia Luna,Greg Chapman,Craig Sapp,David Rizo,Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset for Optical Music Recognition (OMR) research, and introduces OMR-NED, a new metric for detailed OMR evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a comprehensive and fine-grained benchmark and evaluation metric for Optical Music Recognition research, enabling clearer performance comparisons.

Method: Creation of the SMB dataset with diverse musical textures encoded in Humdrum **kern format and development of OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED) metric, improving upon Symbol Error Rate by analyzing errors at the level of individual musical notation elements.

Result: Baseline experiments were conducted using standardized SMB dataset splits to train and evaluate state-of-the-art OMR methods, demonstrating the utility of both the dataset and the evaluation metric.

Conclusion: The introduction of SMB and OMR-NED fills a significant gap in OMR evaluation, providing the research community with effective tools for benchmarking and advancing OMR technology.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical
textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

### [43] [Class-Incremental Learning for Honey Botanical Origin Classification with Hyperspectral Images: A Study with Continual Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10489)
*Guyang Zhang,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies class-incremental learning techniques to distinguish honey botanical origins using hyperspectral imaging, proposing a novel continual backpropagation method that reinitializes neurons to enhance learning plasticity, resulting in a 1-7% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately identifying honey's botanical origin is vital for consumer protection and market value, but training models with all honey varieties simultaneously is impractical, necessitating effective class-incremental learning methods.

Method: The study compares multiple class-incremental learning algorithms on a real honey hyperspectral imaging dataset and proposes a continual backpropagation technique that reinitializes less-used hidden neurons to mitigate loss-of-plasticity in neural networks.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that integrating continual backpropagation improves the performance of most class-incremental learning methods by 1-7%.

Conclusion: Combining continual backpropagation with class-incremental learning effectively enhances model adaptability and accuracy for botanical origin differentiation in honey, offering a promising approach for incremental learning challenges.

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PSLG-SAM, a two-stage framework for Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation that improves segmentation accuracy while reducing annotation burdens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RRSIS methods demand dense annotations and struggle with complex scenes, limiting effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: PSLG-SAM splits segmentation into coarse localization with a visual grounding network and fine segmentation using SAM with a foreground point generator and mask optimization, enabling train-free fine segmentation.

Result: Experiments on RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M datasets show that PSLG-SAM significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Decomposing RRSIS into two stages and leveraging SAM enables improved accuracy and reduced data annotation requirements, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper presents J-DDL, a system combining 2D images and 3D point clouds using laser scanners and cameras to detect and localize fighter aircraft surface damage with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspections of fighter aircraft are limited by scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the aircraft's large surface area and complexity, necessitating a smarter, automated detection system.

Method: J-DDL integrates a novel YOLO-based detection network with lightweight Fasternet blocks, Efficient Multiscale Attention modules, and a new Inner-CIOU loss function for precise 2D damage detection, which is then mapped onto 3D point clouds for accurate localization.

Result: The system streamlines inspections, improves coverage and accuracy of defect detection, and is supported by the first publicly available aircraft damage dataset; experiments validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: J-DDL offers a significant advancement in automated aircraft inspection, enabling more efficient, detailed, and scalable damage detection and localization for fighter aircraft maintenance.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Motivation: Current Vid-LLMs struggle with streaming video reasoning due to processing all historical context, causing computational inefficiency and distraction by irrelevant information.

Method: The authors define the CogStream task to focus on identifying relevant historical context, create a densely annotated dataset via a semi-automatic pipeline, and propose CogReasoner which uses visual stream compression and dialogue retrieval to handle streaming video reasoning efficiently.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CogReasoner effectively addresses the CogStream task, validating the method's efficiency and improved reasoning capability in streaming video scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed CogStream task and CogReasoner model advance streaming video reasoning by reducing computational burdens and improving focus on relevant context, offering a promising direction supported by a new dataset.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

*Imanol Solano,Julian Fierrez,Aythami Morales,Alejandro Peña,Ruben Tolosana,Francisco Zamora-Martinez,Javier San Agustin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a new metric to detect subtle demographic biases in face recognition systems by analyzing score distributions with a focus on tail probabilities, outperforming existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness metrics for face recognition often miss subtle demographic biases, particularly in the tails of score distributions.

Method: CEI separately analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions with configurable focus on distribution tails and shapes; an automated version CEI^A improves practicality and objectivity.

Result: Extensive experiments show CEI's superior sensitivity in detecting nuanced demographic biases across state-of-the-art, biased models, and diverse datasets compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: CEI is a robust, sensitive fairness metric for face biometrics bias evaluation and can be applied generally to analyze statistical distribution tails in various contexts.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos that preserve identities and spatial relationships, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks fail to maintain human and product identities or grasp spatial relationships, resulting in unrealistic and unnatural interactions in demonstration videos.

Method: The approach uses paired human-product reference input, masked cross-attention, 3D body mesh templates with product bounding boxes for motion guidance, and structured text encoding for category semantics, trained on a hybrid augmented dataset.

Result: The method achieves superior maintenance of human and product identity integrity and generates realistic demonstration motions compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed DiT-based framework effectively addresses prior challenges and significantly improves the quality and realism of human-product demonstration video generation.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

*Jun Wang,Lixing Zhu,Xiaohan Yu,Abhir Bhalerao,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PLACE, a framework enhancing medical image-report learning by pathological-level alignment and correlation exploration, improving performance on various tasks without extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in learning medical visual representations from complex, lengthy reports, focusing on pathological-level consistency often overlooked by previous works.

Method: Proposed PLACE framework with pathological-level cross-modal alignment using a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor and a proxy task to find correlations among image patches, independent of external disease annotations.

Result: PLACE achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks such as classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection, and report generation.

Conclusion: Pathological-level alignment and correlation exploration improve fine-grained medical visual representation learning, enhancing multiple medical imaging tasks robustly and generally.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

### [55] [DanceChat: Large Language Model-Guided Music-to-Dance Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10574)
*Qing Wang,Xiaohang Yang,Yilan Dong,Naveen Raj Govindaraj,Gregory Slabaugh,Shanxin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DanceChat is a new method for generating diverse and music-aligned dance motions by using a Large Language Model to create textual choreography instructions, overcoming the limitations of music-only cues and scarce paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing music-to-dance generation faces challenges due to the abstract nature of music, one-to-many mapping between music and dances, and limited paired datasets, making it difficult to produce diverse, musically aligned dances.

Method: DanceChat employs an LLM as a choreographer to generate textual dance instructions, combines these with music and rhythm features in a fused representation, and uses a diffusion-based motion synthesis with multi-modal alignment to produce dances guided by both music and text.

Result: Experiments on the AIST++ dataset and human evaluations show that DanceChat generates dances that are more diverse and better aligned with musical styles compared to state-of-the-art methods, improving both qualitative and quantitative performance.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-generated textual instructions with multi-modal fusion and diffusion-based synthesis effectively addresses the semantic gap and data scarcity in music-to-dance generation, producing superior and diverse dance motions aligned with music.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: T2I-PAL addresses the modality gap in vision-language models like CLIP by generating diverse images from text captions using pre-trained text-to-image models and enhancing multi-label recognition with class-wise heatmaps and prototypes, improving performance without requiring fully annotated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap between image and text features in models like CLIP limits the effectiveness of using text-as-image (TaI) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), particularly for multi-label image recognition.

Method: T2I-PAL uses pre-trained text-to-image generation models to create photo-realistic and varied images from text captions to reduce the modality gap. It incorporates class-wise heatmaps and learnable prototypes to enhance local feature representation and combines prompt tuning with adapter learning for better fine-tuning performance.

Result: Experimental results on MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE benchmarks show T2I-PAL achieves an average of 3.47% improvement over top state-of-the-art methods in multi-label recognition performance.

Conclusion: T2I-PAL effectively reduces the modality gap in CLIP-based PEFT by leveraging generated images and advanced feature aggregation techniques, enabling improved multi-label image recognition without needing fully annotated images, and integrable with existing CLIP frameworks.

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

### [57] [Harmonizing Geometry and Uncertainty: Diffusion with Hyperspheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10576)
*Muskan Dosi,Chiranjeev Chiranjeev,Kartik Thakral,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HyperSphereDiff, a diffusion model designed to preserve class geometry in hyperspherical data by using directional noise aligned with the angular geometry of hyperspheres, improving generative accuracy over standard Euclidean-based diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models use isotropic Gaussian noise suited for Euclidean spaces, which fails to capture the angular patterns in hyperspherical data, leading to loss of class geometry information and suboptimal generative performance.

Method: HyperSphereDiff incorporates directional noise in the forward diffusion process that respects the angular geometry of hyperspherical manifolds, thereby preserving class-specific structures and effectively modeling angular uncertainty.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that HyperSphereDiff better aligns generation with the intrinsic hyperspherical geometry, showing improved generative performance on four object and two face datasets by preserving hyperspherical manifold structures.

Conclusion: Aligning diffusion models with the intrinsic geometry of hyperspherical data using directional noise significantly enhances the quality and geometry-awareness of generated samples compared to conventional Euclidean diffusion approaches.

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

*Jihyeon Seong,Hyunkyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of random masking in Vision Transformer self-distillation (DINO), applying masking only to the student's global view to improve robustness without losing critical information, resulting in better attention maps and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking, while improving training efficiency and regularization, can eliminate critical semantic information in Vision Transformer self-distillation frameworks like DINO; thus, there is a need for more informed masking strategies.

Method: Apply random masking exclusively to the student's global view in the DINO framework, keeping the student's local views and teacher's global view unmasked to combine clean supervision with robustness induced by masking.

Result: This asymmetric masking approach with DINO-Tiny on mini-ImageNet produces more robust and fine-grained attention maps and enhances downstream performance.

Conclusion: Selective random masking in self-distillation effectively balances preserving semantic information and inducing robustness, improving Vision Transformer training outcomes.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

*Jin Huang,Honghua Chen,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HEA-MM, a hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models using 3D scanning and multi-level error analysis to improve manufacturing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aviation equipment requires high quality, performance, stability, and reliability; thus, precise error assessment of CAD models during manufacturing is crucial.

Method: HEA-MM uses structured light scanning to obtain 3D point clouds, registers them with CAD models, and performs error analysis at global, part, and feature levels. It refines point cloud patches via optimization and detects circular holes with a two-stage tensor-voting and hypothesize-and-clusterize algorithm.

Result: Experiments on aircraft CAD models show the framework effectively detects and analyzes errors at multiple hierarchical levels, verifying manufacturing quality.

Conclusion: HEA-MM provides a comprehensive and multi-level error assessment tool that enhances aircraft manufacturing accuracy by integrating 3D measurement with advanced analysis algorithms.

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

*Xinyuan Liu,Hang Xu,Yike Ma,Yucheng Zhang,Feng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SSP, a framework for oriented object detection under point supervision in remote sensing, improving sample assignment and reducing instance confusion, achieving superior mAP results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of labor-intensive annotation and inadequate sample assignment in oriented object detection for densely packed remote sensing scenes under point supervision.

Method: Introduces Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition (SSP) framework with Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based Sample Assignment and Semantic Spatial Partition-based Box Extraction to generate high-quality samples and pseudo-labels for training.

Result: SSP achieves 45.78% mAP on DOTA-v1.0, surpassing the previous best method by 4.10%, and further improves performance when integrated with existing architectures like ORCNN and ReDet.

Conclusion: SSP effectively combines rule-driven priors with data-driven label refinement, significantly improving oriented object detection with point supervision in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is
available at https://github.com/antxinyuan/ssp.

*Eshan Ramesh,Nishio Takayuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatentCSI generates high-quality images from WiFi CSI data using a pretrained latent diffusion model with efficient latent space mapping and text guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient, high-quality method for reconstructing physical environment images from WiFi CSI measurements without relying on complex, computationally heavy techniques like GANs.

Method: A lightweight neural network maps CSI amplitudes into the latent space of a pretrained latent diffusion model, which then performs text-guided denoising diffusion and decoding to produce high-resolution images, bypassing pixel-space generation and explicit encoding.

Result: LatentCSI outperforms similarly complex baselines trained on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual image quality, validated on two WiFi CSI datasets.

Conclusion: LatentCSI offers an efficient, high-quality, and text-controllable approach for generating images from WiFi CSI data, improving over existing methods in performance and usability.

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

*Liang Yin,Xudong Xie,Zhang Li,Xiang Bai,Yuliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSTAR is a box-free scene text retrieval approach that dynamically represents multi-grained text and supports diverse queries, outperforming previous methods without requiring costly bounding box annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on expensive bounding box annotations and the inability of existing methods to unify diverse query types for scene text retrieval.

Method: Introduced MSTAR that uses progressive vision embedding for multi-grained text representation, style-aware instructions for free-style text queries, a multi-instance matching module for better vision-language alignment, and created the MQTR benchmark dataset.

Result: MSTAR outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on seven public datasets and the new MQTR dataset, improving MAP scores by up to 6.4% and 8.5% respectively, while eliminating annotation costs.

Conclusion: MSTAR effectively addresses annotation cost and query diversity issues in scene text retrieval, setting a new standard for performance and versatility in the field.

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

### [63] [TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10612)
*Suin Lee,Dae-Shik Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TexTailor is a new method for generating consistent object textures from text by improving texture integration during synthesis and adaptively selecting camera viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for text-to-texture synthesis suffer from inconsistency across multiple viewpoints due to poor integration of previous textures and fixed camera positions that ignore object geometry.

Method: TexTailor uses a resampling scheme to better integrate previously synthesized textures in the diffusion process, fine-tunes a depth-aware diffusion model with a performance preservation loss to maintain image fidelity, and adaptively adjusts camera positions based on object geometry.

Result: Experiments on Objaverse and ShapeNet car datasets show TexTailor outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in generating view-consistent textures.

Conclusion: By addressing texture integration and viewpoint selection issues, TexTailor significantly improves the consistency of textures synthesized from textual descriptions across multiple viewpoints.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

*Konstantinos Vilouras,Ilias Stogiannidis,Junyu Yan,Alison Q. O'Neil,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses improving alignment between chest X-ray images and radiology reports using Latent Diffusion Models, achieving state-of-the-art results in phrase grounding on medical imaging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent Diffusion Models excel in text-guided image synthesis for natural images but underperform in medical imaging due to limited data and poor alignment of clinical information with images.

Method: The authors propose a fine-tuning framework to enhance multi-modal alignment in a pre-trained text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model, enabling effective phrase grounding in chest X-rays.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MS-CXR benchmark and shows strong generalization on out-of-distribution data like VinDr-CXR.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning Latent Diffusion Models improves multi-modal alignment between radiology reports and chest X-rays, facilitating downstream medical imaging tasks with improved accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model that can handle semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation simultaneously, ensuring bi-directional consistency and preserving semantic information.

Method: SymmFlow employs a symmetric learning objective modeling forward and reverse transformations together with a new training objective to retain semantic information and enable efficient one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. It supports flexible conditioning beyond strict one-to-one mask-image mappings.

Result: SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on CelebAMask-HQ (11.9) and COCO-Stuff (7.0) with only 25 inference steps, and shows competitive performance on semantic segmentation and classification tasks.

Conclusion: SymmFlow successfully unifies multiple vision tasks within a single model with efficient sampling and high performance, demonstrating its potential as a versatile tool in generative modeling and vision tasks.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly

TL;DR: GigaVideo-1 is a fine-tuning framework for video diffusion models that improves video generation quality without extra human supervision, using automatic feedback and prompt-driven data generation with a reward-guided training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models need fine-tuning to improve specific qualities like instance preservation and motion rationality, but current methods require heavy human annotation and computational resources, limiting practical use.

Method: GigaVideo-1 uses a prompt-driven data engine to generate diverse training samples targeting model weaknesses, combined with a reward-guided optimization that adaptively weighs samples based on feedback from pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint.

Result: Evaluated on VBench-2.0 against Wan2.1 baseline, GigaVideo-1 improves performance across 17 evaluation dimensions by about 4% on average, requiring only 4 GPU-hours and no manual annotations or large real datasets.

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1 effectively and efficiently enhances pre-trained video diffusion models' generation quality without human supervision, presenting a practical fine-tuning approach for video generation.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and

*Marzieh Oghbaie,Teresa Araújoa,Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PiPViT is a vision transformer-based prototypical model that improves interpretability in medical image classification by learning human-interpretable prototypes of lesions, leveraging image-level labels and multi-resolution inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prototype-based methods in medical imaging struggle with interpretability and mapping prototypes to meaningful clinical biomarkers, limiting their practical use for diagnosis.

Method: PiPViT uses a vision transformer framework to capture long-range patch dependencies, employing contrastive learning and multi-resolution inputs to learn prototypes that reflect lesion extent based only on image-level labels.

Result: PiPViT performs competitively on retinal OCT classification across four datasets, with prototypes that are semantically and clinically relevant, providing more meaningful explanations than prior approaches.

Conclusion: PiPViT offers transparent, clinically meaningful explanations for diagnostic decisions and has potential to aid clinicians by bridging the gap between model interpretability and medical understanding.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes use advanced AI to create realistic manipulated content that surpasses traditional detection methods, requiring efficient yet effective detection models.

Method: A lightweight CNN integrated with squeeze and excitation (SE) blocks to recalibrate features channel-wise, enhancing informative features while suppressing less useful ones, combined in a simple sequential model.

Result: Achieved 94.14% classification accuracy and 0.985 AUC-ROC on Style GAN dataset, matching performance of existing larger models.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides an effective, resource-efficient approach for deepfake detection, enabling scalable digital content verification solutions.

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel framework generating high-quality adversarial CAPTCHAs guided by text prompts, improving attack stealth and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHA schemes are increasingly vulnerable to DNN-based attacks, but existing adversarial methods cause distortions reducing human usability and require original images, limiting their practicality.

Method: UAC uses Large Language Models to guide CAPTCHA generation with both targeted (via EDICT optimizing dual latent variables in diffusion models) and untargeted attacks (via BP-UAC, a two-step bi-path optimization leveraging multimodal gradients) to produce high-fidelity, diverse adversarial examples.

Result: BP-UAC demonstrates high success rates in fooling various CAPTCHA systems while generating natural-looking images indistinguishable to humans and DNNs, including effective black-box attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed UAC framework advances adversarial CAPTCHA generation by producing diverse, natural, and effective adversarial examples without relying on original images, enhancing attack versatility and stealth.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

### [70] [Underage Detection through a Multi-Task and MultiAge Approach for Screening Minors in Unconstrained Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10689)
*Christopher Gaul,Eduardo Fidalgo,Enrique Alegre,Rocío Alaiz Rodríguez,Eri Pérez Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-task model for accurately screening minors under various challenging conditions by addressing data imbalance and domain shifts, using a novel architecture and loss function, and validates it on a new benchmark with improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust automatic minor screening systems that handle distribution shifts and address the under-representation of children in available datasets, focusing on legally critical age ranges.

Method: A multi-task architecture built on a frozen vision-language backbone combined with a two-layer MLP, incorporating multiple binary under-age classification heads and an age regression head. The training employs an alpha-reweighted focal loss, age-balanced mini-batch sampling, and an age gap technique to mitigate class imbalance and edge cases. A comprehensive evaluation benchmark, including clean training/test sets and challenging real-world image shifts, was proposed.

Result: The proposed model reduced root-mean-square-error in age estimation and significantly improved under-age detection across multiple thresholds, achieving higher F2 scores and maintaining high recall under distribution shifts and low-quality image conditions on the benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The multi-age multi-task model with tailored loss functions and balanced sampling effectively improves accurate minor screening in unconstrained environments, demonstrating strong generalization to challenging, real-world images and domain shifts.

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

*Melika Ayoughi,Mina Ghadimi Atigh,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Cees G. M. Snoek,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel continual learning task involving simultaneous learning of instances and classes, posing challenges of multi-level granularity. The authors propose HyperCLIC, an algorithm that exploits hyperbolic space to capture inherent hierarchical relationships between classes and instances. They also introduce new evaluation metrics and validate their method on the EgoObjects dataset, demonstrating improved hierarchical generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications such as robotics and self-driving cars necessitate models that can continually learn both specific instances and broader classes simultaneously, reflecting the hierarchical nature of data and varying granularity in recognition tasks.

Method: The paper proposes HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm leveraging hyperbolic space to model hierarchical relationships between classes and instances. It features hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives to embed hierarchical relations continually and introduces continual hierarchical metrics for evaluation.

Result: Empirical evaluations on the EgoObjects dataset show that HyperCLIC effectively learns at multiple granularity levels and improves hierarchical generalization compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: Modeling hierarchical class-instance relationships in hyperbolic space enables better continual learning performance across different levels of granularity, making HyperCLIC suitable for complex real-world recognition tasks requiring simultaneous instance and class learning.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

### [72] [Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion for Camouflaged Object Detection Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10712)
*Yuqi Shen,Fengyang Xiao,Sujie Hu,Youwei Pang,Yifan Pu,Chengyu Fang,Xiu Li,Chunming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UMBD, a generative refinement framework using uncertainty-guided Bernoulli diffusion to improve camouflaged object detection by refining poor segmentation regions while preserving good ones, supported by a hybrid uncertainty estimation network HUQNet, achieving consistent performance gains on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camouflaged object detection methods can be improved further by post-processing refinement, which has not been fully explored, especially to selectively improve poor segmentation areas without harming correctly segmented ones.

Method: UMBD applies uncertainty-guided Bernoulli diffusion only to residual regions with poor segmentation quality, using HUQNet for multi-source uncertainty estimation to guide adaptive generative sampling; it complements existing Encoder-Decoder COD models by adding generative diffusion refinement.

Result: Experiments on multiple camouflaged object detection benchmarks show consistent improvements, achieving average performance gains of 5.5% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 3.2% increase in weighted F-measure, with modest computational cost.

Conclusion: UMBD effectively enhances existing COD models by leveraging uncertainty-guided diffusion refinement, providing a novel and practical approach that demonstrably improves detection accuracy with efficient integration and deployment.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

*Emílio Dolgener Cantú,Rolf Klemens Wittmann,Oliver Abdeen,Patrick Wagner,Wojciech Samek,Moritz Baier,Sebastian Lapuschkin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning approach to generate synthetic golden standards for defect detection in InP wafer manufacturing, improving upon manual and baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In InP wafer manufacturing, the lack of golden standards due to low production scale and high design variability makes defect detection manual and labor-intensive.

Method: The authors use Deep Neural Networks to simulate photo-realistic wafer images from CAD data, experimenting with different training objectives and evaluating image quality.

Result: The deep learning method outperforms a decision-tree baseline and allows creation of simulated golden dies in any wafer region, enhancing defect detection efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a practical, effective template matching approach for surface defect detection in InP wafer manufacturing, reducing reliance on manual inspection.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

*Hong Huang,Weixiang Sun,Zhijian Wu,Jingwen Niu,Donghuan Lu,Xian Wu,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IQE-CLIP is a medical domain vision-language anomaly detection framework that integrates textual and instance-aware visual information for improved zero- and few-shot detection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based ZFSAD methods rely on prior category knowledge and designed prompts that often fail in joint embedding space, with limited application to medical tasks.

Method: IQE-CLIP uses class-based and learnable prompting tokens plus an instance-aware query module extracting region-level multimodal context to generate anomaly-sensitive embeddings.

Result: Extensive experiments on six medical datasets show IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Integrating textual and instance-aware visual information with adaptive prompting effectively improves anomaly detection in medical images using vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PosterCraft is a unified framework for generating high-quality aesthetic posters by optimizing text rendering, layout, and style through a multi-stage training process, outperforming current open-source methods and rivaling commercial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating aesthetic posters is complex, requiring precise text rendering, artistic content integration, and harmonious layouts, which existing modular and rigid pipeline approaches fail to achieve effectively.

Method: PosterCraft uses a cascaded workflow including large-scale text-rendering optimization on a new Text-Render-2M dataset, region-aware fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K, aesthetic-text reinforcement learning with preference optimization, and joint vision-language feedback refinement, supported by automated data pipelines.

Result: The framework significantly improves text rendering accuracy, layout coherence, and visual appeal over open-source baselines, approaching state-of-the-art commercial poster generation quality.

Conclusion: PosterCraft successfully abandons modular and rigid layout designs to achieve coherent, visually compelling poster generation through a multi-stage training approach with automated data support, offering a competitive open-source solution for high-quality poster creation.

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SbCA is a unified model for ultra-large image upsampling that uses stroke vector amplification and cyclic refinement, overcoming blurring and artifacts seen in prior methods when upsampling beyond training scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing arbitrary-scale super-resolution methods perform poorly and produce blurring when upsampling factors exceed training data ranges.

Method: They propose the Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), which decomposes images into stroke vectors for magnification and includes a detail completion module, using a cyclic strategy to iteratively refine details at sub-scales within training range, all trained once.

Result: SbCA effectively eliminates artifacts, noise, and blurring, producing high-quality super-resolved images at ultra-large scales (e.g., 100x), outperforming state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: SbCA successfully addresses distribution drift and scale limitations in ultra-large image super-resolution, delivering superior visual quality with a unified model trained only once.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotPi is a physics-informed, object-centric model that integrates physical knowledge via Hamiltonian principles with spatio-temporal prediction, enabling accurate dynamic forecasting and reasoning in scenarios involving objects and fluid dynamics. It outperforms existing methods and demonstrates adaptability across synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object-centric dynamic simulation methods lack integration of physical knowledge and fail to validate model adaptability across diverse scenarios involving complex dynamics like fluids and object interactions. Humans naturally use physical insights to reason about dynamics, which current models do not replicate effectively.

Method: SlotPi introduces a slot-based physics-informed object-centric reasoning model combining a physical module grounded in Hamiltonian mechanics with a spatio-temporal prediction module for forecasting dynamics. It is designed to simulate both object interactions and fluid flow characteristics effectively.

Result: Experiments show that SlotPi excels at prediction tasks and Visual Question Answering on benchmark and fluid-related datasets. Additionally, a new real-world dataset of object and fluid interactions was introduced, where SlotPi demonstrated robust and adaptable performance.

Conclusion: SlotPi's integration of physics-informed reasoning and object-centric modeling significantly improves dynamic simulation and reasoning capabilities, especially with complex fluid-object interactions. Its strong adaptability across datasets paves the way toward more advanced, generalizable world models.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Motivation: Traditional image-based navigation controllers run at fixed rates and suffer from issues like motion blur and latency, limiting real-time responsiveness and robustness in dynamic environments.

Method: The approach utilizes the asynchronous event cameras combined with other sensors, integrates event-based perception and range sensing, and employs Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for policy optimization. An initial imitation learning phase is used to improve sample efficiency.

Result: The system shows promising performance in simulated environments, effectively executing robust navigation, pedestrian following, and obstacle avoidance tasks.

Conclusion: Using event cameras with reinforcement learning enables more flexible, adaptive, and robust robot navigation compared to conventional fixed-rate image-based methods.

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event
cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time
human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional
image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion
blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated
environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and
obstacle avoidance. A demo video is available at the project website.

*Mario Barbara,Alaa Maalouf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Prompts-to-Summaries, a zero-shot, user-controllable video summarizer that leverages pretrained video-language and large language models to generate user-guided video summaries without any training data, outperforming existing unsupervised methods and matching supervised ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for flexible video summarization tools that generalize across domains and incorporate natural language user intent, but existing methods are either domain-specific or cannot process textual queries effectively.

Method: The method segments raw video into scenes, generates scene-level descriptions using a memory-efficient video-language model prompting strategy, applies a large language model to score scene importance based on user prompts, and propagates scores to finer segment levels using novel temporal consistency and uniqueness metrics.

Result: On benchmarks like SumMe and TVSum, the zero-shot approach outperforms all prior unsupervised methods and competes well on query-focused summarization tasks, despite not using any training data. A new challenging dataset, VidSum-Reason, is also introduced where the framework shows robust performance.

Conclusion: Pretrained multimodal models combined with principled prompting and score propagation techniques provide a strong foundation for universal, text-queryable video summarization without requiring domain-specific training data.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module to improve unsupervised deformable image registration (DIR) by enforcing smoothness and message passing, effectively handling sparse features and large displacements, especially in retinal vessel images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised DIR struggles with images having sparse features and large smooth regions, like retinal vessels, due to unresolved aperture and large-displacement challenges and lack of regularization post-training.

Method: SmoothProper integrates a duality-based optimization layer with interaction terms within the neural network's forward pass, propagating flow signals spatially while enforcing smoothness and structural consistency, and is model-agnostic with minimal parameter overhead.

Result: SmoothProper achieved a registration error of 1.88 pixels on high-resolution retinal vessel images (2912x2912), demonstrating effective unsupervised DIR performance on challenging aperture and large-displacement scenarios for the first time.

Conclusion: SmoothProper effectively addresses key limitations in unsupervised DIR by enforcing smoothness and message passing, easily integrates into existing frameworks, eliminates hyperparameter tuning, and shows promising results on difficult image registration tasks.

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of hand-object pose estimation in monocular RGB images under occlusions by proposing HOMAE, an occlusion-aware method using masked autoencoders with a target-focused masking strategy and multi-scale feature fusion of signed distance fields and point clouds, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with severe occlusions in hand-object interactions due to insufficient exploitation of global structural perception and reasoning.

Method: HOMAE employs a target-focused masking strategy to learn context-aware features for occluded regions, predicts signed distance fields from multi-scale decoder features, and fuses implicit SDF with explicit point clouds to enhance geometric perception.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks DexYCB and HO3Dv2 for hand-object pose estimation.

Conclusion: HOMAE effectively handles occlusions in hand-object pose estimation by integrating global and local geometric features, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness, with plans to release code and models.

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

TL;DR: VideoDeepResearch leverages a text-only large reasoning model with multimodal tools to improve long video understanding, outperforming existing baselines significantly on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video understanding is challenging due to complexity and context limitations in current multi-modal large language models; the paper aims to challenge the belief that extended context and strong visual models are necessary.

Method: The method uses a text-only large reasoning model combined with a modular multimodal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, to generate problem-solving strategies and selectively access video content for LVU tasks.

Result: The approach improved performance by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% over previous state-of-the-art on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench respectively.

Conclusion: Agentic frameworks like VideoDeepResearch, relying on reasoning and tool usage rather than heavy multimodal foundation models, are effective for long video understanding challenges.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

### [83] [Post-Training Quantization for Video Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10840)
*Tianrui Zhu,Houyuan Chen,Ruihao Gong,Michele Magno,Haotong Qin,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PTQ4VM, a novel post-training quantization framework for video matting models on resource-constrained devices, achieving near full-precision performance at low bit-widths with significant computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying computationally intensive video matting models on resource-limited devices is challenging, particularly maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence after quantization.

Method: A two-stage PTQ approach combining block-reconstruction optimization for initial quantization and global calibration of parameters (GAC), plus Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) to use temporal-semantic cues for better foreground distinction.

Result: PTQ4VM reduces quantization errors by up to 20%, maintains near full-precision accuracy even at 4-bit quantization, and achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8x reduction in FLOPs compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PTQ4VM is an effective, general PTQ framework for video matting that significantly compresses models while preserving accuracy and temporal coherence, suitable for deployment on constrained devices.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRBench is a new benchmark with 1,010 long narrative videos and 9,468 multi-step QA pairs for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning, especially temporal reasoning and procedural validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of large models overlook temporal reasoning and procedural validity in multi-step reasoning over long narrative videos.

Method: VRBench includes long videos with multi-step QA pairs and reasoning steps with timestamps, curated for plot coherence, and uses a human-AI framework to generate reasoning chains. A multi-phase evaluation pipeline assesses models at outcome and process levels with multi-dimensional scoring.

Result: Evaluated 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on VRBench, providing comprehensive analysis and insights on multi-step reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: VRBench advances the evaluation of multi-step reasoning in large models by addressing temporal and procedural aspects and enabling thorough performance analysis via new metrics.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

### [85] [CreatiPoster: Towards Editable and Controllable Multi-Layer Graphic Design Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10890)
*Zhao Zhang,Yutao Cheng,Dexiang Hong,Maoke Yang,Gonglei Shi,Lei Ma,Hui Zhang,Jie Shao,Xinglong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CreatiPoster is a framework that generates editable, multi-layer graphic designs from language instructions or assets, outperforming existing open-source and commercial tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality, editable graphic designs is difficult and time-consuming, especially for beginners. Current AI tools fail to integrate user inputs well, maintain editability, and achieve professional look, while commercial systems depend on large template libraries that are hard to replicate.

Method: CreatiPoster uses an RGBA multimodal protocol model to create a detailed JSON specification of each design layer with layout and style, followed by a background synthesis model conditioned on foreground layers. This allows for editable, layered compositions from natural language or assets.

Result: CreatiPoster outperforms leading open-source and proprietary commercial graphic design generation methods on automated benchmark metrics. It also supports diverse features like canvas editing, resizing, multilingual adaptation, and animations.

Conclusion: By enabling editable, multi-layer AI-generated graphic designs with a modular approach and releasing a large free dataset, CreatiPoster advances accessible AI-assisted graphic design and encourages further research in the area.

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

### [86] [AIR: Zero-shot Generative Model Adaptation with Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10895)
*Guimeng Liu,Milad Abdollahzadeh,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses the misalignment issue between image and text offsets in CLIP space that affects zero-shot generative model adaptation. It proposes AIR, an iterative refinement method, to enhance image quality, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot generative model adaptation methods assume perfect alignment between image and text offsets in CLIP embedding space, which leads to degraded image quality. The study is motivated by the need to understand and correct this misalignment to improve generated images.

Method: The authors perform an empirical study to measure offset misalignment between image and text embeddings related to concept distance. Based on these insights, they propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR), an approach that iteratively refines the adaptation process to improve image quality without requiring target domain samples.

Result: Experiments across 26 setups, including qualitative, quantitative, and user studies, show that AIR consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot generative model adaptation.

Conclusion: Addressing offset misalignment between image and text embeddings using the AIR method significantly enhances the quality of adapted generative models, setting a new SOTA in zero-shot generative model adaptation.

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

*Jiancheng Huang,Gengwei Zhang,Zequn Jie,Siyu Jiao,Yinlong Qian,Ling Chen,Yunchao Wei,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for efficient text-to-video generation that reduces computational costs while maintaining high-quality video output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video generation is computationally demanding due to the quadratic complexity of Transformers in spatiotemporal sequence processing, limiting practical applications.

Method: M4V introduces multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) blocks for integrating multi-modal information via token re-composition, significantly reducing FLOPs, and employs a reward learning strategy to improve visual quality in long-context autoregressive generation.

Result: M4V reduces computational costs by 45% compared to attention-based methods when generating high-resolution videos and achieves superior visual realism, validated through extensive benchmark experiments.

Conclusion: M4V successfully addresses efficiency and quality challenges in text-to-video generation, enabling practical, high-quality multi-modal video synthesis with lower computational demands.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel in-context image editing model trained directly from videos using a block-causal diffusion transformer. It introduces a scalable video annotation approach and three proxy training tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on multi-turn image editing benchmarks and showing promising abilities in complex editing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-context image editing methods rely on task-specific pipelines and expert models to curate training data, which can be limiting and cumbersome. The paper explores whether such models can instead be learned directly from videos to simplify and scale the training process.

Method: The authors develop a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences and design a block-causal diffusion transformer model trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction. They also propose a new multi-turn image editing benchmark to evaluate the method.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Additionally, it shows promising abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing, despite being trained solely on videos.

Conclusion: Training an in-context image editing model directly from annotated videos with a block-causal diffusion transformer is effective, scalable, and can outperform existing task-specific methods, advancing research in multi-turn image editing and related applications.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

*Yuanhui Huang,Weiliang Chen,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SpectralAR, a new visual generation framework that models images autoregressively using spectral tokens representing frequency components to achieve causality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive visual generation methods use spatial patches, which conflict with autoregressive causality because patches are parallel.

Method: Images are tokenized into ordered spectral tokens from low to high frequency via Nested Spectral Tokenization, and autoregressive generation is performed in a coarse-to-fine manner over these spectral sequences.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID using only 64 tokens and 310M parameters, outperforming baselines in image reconstruction and generation.

Conclusion: SpectralAR effectively bridges the gap between autoregressive causality and visual generation by leveraging spectral token sequences, resulting in efficient and high-quality image generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the task of knowledge image generation and the MMMG benchmark to evaluate reasoning in image generation models, revealing significant current deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge images are vital for human learning and cognition, but generating them requires complex multimodal reasoning that integrates world knowledge and pixel-level detail.

Method: The authors propose the MMMG benchmark with 4,456 expert-validated image-prompt pairs across multiple disciplines and educational levels, use a unified Knowledge Graph representation for evaluation, and create the MMMG-Score metric combining factual and visual assessment. They also release FLUX-Reason, an open baseline model.

Result: Evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art models show poor performance in entity fidelity, relation accuracy, and clarity, with the best model scoring just over 50 on MMMG-Score. FLUX-Reason achieves a lower score of 34.45 but serves as a strong baseline.

Conclusion: Current text-to-image models lack reasoning capabilities needed for accurate knowledge image generation; the introduced benchmark and baseline aim to catalyze progress in this challenging new task.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

*Qizhe Zhang,Mengzhen Liu,Lichen Li,Ming Lu,Yuan Zhang,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CDPruner is a novel visual token pruning method for multimodal large language models that maximizes conditional diversity of retained tokens using determinantal point process, improving efficiency and performance during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multimodal large language models, the input visual tokens are much longer than textual tokens, causing high inference cost. Existing pruning methods are suboptimal due to retaining duplicates or ignoring instruction relevance.

Method: CDPruner defines conditional similarity between visual tokens based on instructions, then uses determinantal point process (DPP) to select a subset of tokens that maximizes conditional diversity. It is training-free, model-agnostic, and easily applicable to various MLLMs.

Result: Experiments show CDPruner achieves state-of-the-art results on several vision-language benchmarks, maintaining strong accuracy while drastically reducing FLOPs (95%) and CUDA latency (78%) on LLaVA, preserving 94% of original accuracy.

Conclusion: Maximizing conditional diversity of visual tokens through DPP enables efficient and effective token pruning, significantly reducing inference costs while maintaining high performance in multimodal large language models.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenWorld, a large-scale dataset for detecting AI-generated videos replicating real-world scenarios, and proposes SpannDetector, a model using multi-view consistency to improve detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic AI-generated videos undermines trust in real-world information, and existing detectors lack high-quality real-world datasets, limiting efficacy.

Method: GenWorld dataset is created using multiple state-of-the-art video generators with diverse prompts to simulate real-world videos; SpannDetector leverages multi-view consistency to improve detection of high-quality forgeries.

Result: Existing methods fail on high-quality AI-generated videos; SpannDetector outperforms them by using physical plausibility criteria, demonstrating superior detection capability.

Conclusion: GenWorld and SpannDetector provide valuable resources and techniques, advancing trustworthy and explainable AI-generated video detection focused on real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

*Sicheng Zuo,Wenzhao Zheng,Xiaoyong Han,Longchao Yang,Yong Pan,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes QuadricFormer, a model using superquadrics for efficient 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, improving over previous methods by representing diverse object shapes more compactly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D occupancy prediction methods rely on dense voxel grids or ellipsoidal Gaussian representations, which are inefficient due to scene sparsity and limited shape expressiveness, respectively. Real-world driving scenes contain diverse object geometries that require a more flexible and efficient representation.

Method: The authors introduce a probabilistic superquadric mixture model interpreting each superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with shape priors. They develop QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model utilizing these primitives, and incorporate a pruning-and-splitting module to focus representation on occupied regions, enhancing efficiency.

Result: Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction accuracy while being more computationally efficient compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Using superquadrics as scene primitives allows compact, expressive, and efficient 3D occupancy modeling, enabling better performance for autonomous driving perception systems.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

### [94] [Fine-Grained Perturbation Guidance via Attention Head Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10978)
*Donghoon Ahn,Jiwon Kang,Sanghyun Lee,Minjae Kim,Jaewon Min,Wooseok Jang,Saungwu Lee,Sayak Paul,Susung Hong,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HeadHunter, a method for fine-grained attention perturbation in Diffusion Transformer models to improve image generation quality and style control by selectively manipulating attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention perturbation methods for guiding diffusion models lack principled ways to determine where to apply perturbations, especially in DiT architectures where attention roles vary across heads, limiting control over generation quality and styles.

Method: The authors analyze attention perturbations at multiple granularities, discover that specific heads correspond to distinct visual concepts, and propose HeadHunter to iteratively select heads for perturbation. They also introduce SoftPAG to enable smooth tuning of perturbation strength by interpolating attention maps toward identity matrices.

Result: Their method mitigates oversmoothing from layer-level perturbations and allows targeted manipulation of visual styles through compositional head selection. Experiments on large-scale DiT-based models like Stable Diffusion 3 show superior general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance performance.

Conclusion: HeadHunter provides the first head-level analysis and control in attention perturbations for diffusion models, revealing interpretable attention head specializations and enabling practical and effective generation quality and style control strategies.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

*Junqi You,Chieh Hubert Lin,Weijie Lyu,Zhengbo Zhang,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaInpaint is a fast, reference-based feed-forward framework that achieves real-time 3D scene inpainting within 0.4 seconds, vastly outperforming existing methods in speed while maintaining state-of-the-art quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene inpainting methods are too slow and computationally expensive for real-time and interactive applications in VR/AR, limiting their usability for immersive operations such as object manipulation.

Method: The paper proposes InstaInpaint, which uses a 2D inpainting proposal as reference and a self-supervised masked-finetuning approach to train a custom large reconstruction model on a large dataset, resulting in improved generalization, texture, and geometry restoration.

Result: InstaInpaint achieves a 1000x speed-up compared to prior methods and maintains state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks, also showing strong generalization to applications like object insertion and multi-region inpainting.

Conclusion: InstaInpaint enables practical real-time 3D scene inpainting for interactive VR/AR applications, balancing speed and quality and supporting flexible downstream use cases.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

### [96] [SceneCompleter: Dense 3D Scene Completion for Generative Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10981)
*Weiliang Chen,Jiayi Bi,Yuanhui Huang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneCompleter is a framework for 3D-consistent novel view synthesis that uses a dual-stream diffusion model and a scene embedder to generate coherent RGBD images from sparse input views, improving over traditional 2D-first generative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative novel view synthesis methods rely on 2D image completion followed by 3D reconstruction, leading to smooth and distorted geometry due to limited 3D structure inference.

Method: SceneCompleter employs a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model to synthesize novel RGBD views and a scene embedder to encode holistic scene understanding, enabling dense 3D scene completion and coherence.

Result: The method produces superior visual coherence and plausible 3D-consistent novel views across various datasets, outperforming existing paradigms.

Conclusion: By fusing structural and textural information through a dual-stream model and an embedding approach, SceneCompleter effectively addresses 3D scene completion for consistent novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

*Chenjian Gao,Lihe Ding,Xin Cai,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a mask-based LoRA tuning method to adapt pretrained Image-to-Video models for flexible and efficient video editing, preserving background while propagating controllable edits using additional visual references and spatial masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods using diffusion models rely heavily on large-scale pretraining and lack flexibility, especially in controlling edits beyond the first video frame.

Method: They introduce a mask-based Low-Rank Adaptation tuning that adapts a pretrained Image-to-Video model by incorporating spatial masks and additional reference images, enabling region-specific learning and better steering of edits without changing the model architecture.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, effectively balancing background preservation with controllable edits propagation.

Conclusion: The mask-based LoRA tuning provides an efficient, adaptable approach to video editing that enhances control and flexibility beyond existing methods without requiring architectural changes.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Bin Guo,John H. L. Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepTraverse is a vision architecture inspired by classical search algorithms, using recursive exploration and adaptive calibration to iteratively refine features, achieving competitive image classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional vision backbones have uniform, cascaded feature processing with limited adaptive refinement and interpretability. Incorporating structured, algorithmic principles from search algorithms could enable more logical, interpretable, and efficient feature learning.

Method: DeepTraverse uses recursive exploration modules to deepen feature analysis along promising paths with parameter sharing, and adaptive calibration modules to dynamically adjust feature salience based on global context, enabling systematic and adaptive feature refinement.

Result: DeepTraverse achieves highly competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination on diverse image classification benchmarks, often outperforming conventional models of similar or larger size.

Conclusion: Integrating classical search algorithm principles into vision backbones provides a principled, effective approach to build more efficient, structured, and high-performing feature learning architectures.

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable progress estimation models to adapt online to varied visual and temporal contexts and generalize across diverse, out-of-distribution tasks and environments.

Method: A gradient-based meta-learning strategy trains the model on expert visual trajectories and their natural language task descriptions with a learned self-supervised objective, enabling online adaptation at test time.

Result: The proposed method generalizes well from a single training environment to diverse out-of-distribution scenarios and outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive vision-language model approaches.

Conclusion: Test-time adaptation through gradient-based meta-learning effectively enhances progress estimation by leveraging semantic content over temporal order across diverse tasks and environments.

Abstract: We propose a test-time adaptation method that enables a progress estimation

*Yantai Yang,Yuhao Wang,Zichen Wen,Luo Zhongwei,Chang Zou,Zhipeng Zhang,Chuan Wen,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientVLA accelerates Vision-Language-Action models by reducing computational and memory redundancies without training, achieving nearly double speed with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models, especially diffusion-based ones, have high computational and memory demands due to redundancies, limiting their practical use. Current acceleration methods only address parts of these inefficiencies and don't offer a holistic solution.

Method: EfficientVLA uses a structured, training-free inference acceleration approach combining three strategies: pruning redundant layers in the language module, selecting a compact and diverse set of visual tokens to optimize visual processing, and caching intermediate features in the diffusion-based action module to reduce temporal redundancy.

Result: Applying EfficientVLA to the CogACT model achieved a 1.93X speedup in inference, reduced FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% drop in success rate on the SIMPLER benchmark.

Conclusion: EfficientVLA effectively and holistically eliminates computational and memory bottlenecks in VLA models, greatly improving inference efficiency with negligible performance degradation, thereby enhancing practical deployability.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), a multi-modal dataset consisting of 10,000 image-caption pairs labeled for the presence of children, designed to benchmark and improve machine learning tools that detect digital content depicting minors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the lack of existing datasets or benchmarks for detecting content depicting minors in a multi-modal context, the paper aims to fill this gap to support the development and evaluation of automated detection systems.

Method: The authors created ICCWD, a diverse dataset containing images and captions labeled for child presence, and benchmarked three detection methods—including a commercial age estimation system—using this data.

Result: The study found that detecting children in digital content is challenging, with the best detection method achieving only a 75.3% true positive rate on ICCWD.

Conclusion: The release of ICCWD will facilitate the development of more accurate and robust child detection methods across various scenarios, improving regulation and automated screening of minor-related digital content.

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Result: Both models achieved high prediction metrics; DaViT-B ViT had the best performance with a 96.4% f1-score, outperforming CNNs with smaller model size.

Conclusion: ViTs, particularly DaViT-B, are highly effective and efficient for medical image classification of psoriasis, demonstrating their potential in this domain.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural

images containing lesions of psoriasis and diseases similar to it. Models
pre-trained on ImageNet were adapted to a specific data set. Both achieved high
predictive metrics, but the ViTs stood out for their superior performance with
smaller models. Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base (DaViT-B) obtained the
best results, with an f1-score of 96.4%, and is recommended as the most
efficient architecture for automated psoriasis detection. This article
reinforces the potential of ViTs for medical image classification tasks.

TL;DR: This paper proposes ViCrit, a reinforcement learning task where vision-language models learn to detect subtle synthetic hallucination errors in image captions, improving visual perception capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL fine-tuning methods work well on language tasks but struggle with vision-language models due to a lack of challenging, verifiable vision tasks.

Method: Introduce ViCrit, an RL proxy task prompting models to localize visual description errors in captions, providing clear binary rewards based on exact detection of corrupted caption spans.

Result: Models trained on ViCrit show significant improvements across various vision-language benchmarks, including abstract reasoning and visual math tasks, beyond natural image domains.

Conclusion: Fine-grained hallucination detection serves as a robust and generalizable objective to significantly enhance the visual perception ability of vision-language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

TL;DR: RoCA is a novel framework for robust end-to-end autonomous driving that enhances cross-domain generalization and adaptation without extra inference cost, using Gaussian processes to model trajectories probabilistically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying end-to-end autonomous driving systems across different domains (e.g., cities) where domain adaptation and cross-domain generalization are problematic, especially with the use of LLMs that have retraining cost and uncertain cross-domain performance.

Method: RoCA formulates a joint probabilistic distribution over tokens encoding ego and surrounding vehicle information, instantiated with a Gaussian process that learns basis tokens and trajectories spanning diverse scenarios, allowing probabilistic future trajectory inference. It is trained with a base E2E model in the source domain to improve generalizability without extra inference cost, and it facilitates robust target domain adaptation outperforming finetuning.

Result: RoCA achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation on various cross-domain scenarios, significantly outperforming direct finetuning and not requiring additional inference computation.

Conclusion: RoCA effectively enhances cross-domain robustness in end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging probabilistic modeling with Gaussian processes, enabling better generalization and adaptation performance than existing methods.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

*Mohammad Jalali,Haoyu Lei,Amin Gohari,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SPARKE, a prompt-aware diversity guidance method for diffusion models to improve diversity in generated images efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt-guided diffusion models struggle to maintain adequate diversity across semantically similar prompts, and existing diversity measure methods are computationally expensive for large-scale generation.

Method: The authors introduce SPARKE, which uses conditional entropy on similar prompts for diversity guidance and reduces computational complexity from O(n^3) to O(n) through Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, enabling large-scale diversity-guided sampling.

Result: Experiments on several text-to-image diffusion models show SPARKE improves prompt-aware diversity without significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: SPARKE effectively enhances diversity in prompt-guided diffusion models at scale and is computationally efficient, making it practical for large-scale generative tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

### [107] [Retrieval of Surface Solar Radiation through Implicit Albedo Recovery from Temporal Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10174)
*Yael Frischholz,Devis Tuia,Michael Lehning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an attention-based emulator using a Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer to accurately retrieve surface solar radiation from satellite imagery, especially in challenging mountainous regions with dynamic snow cover, outperforming traditional methods that rely on static albedo maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current satellite retrieval algorithms for surface solar radiation struggle in mountainous regions due to dynamic and intermittent snow cover, which violates the assumption of slowly varying surface properties used in operational models.

Method: An attention-based emulator leveraging multi-spectral satellite images, static topographic features, and solar geometry inputs was trained to infer clear-sky surface reflectance and SSR without explicit albedo or cloud masks using the Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer.

Result: The model matched the performance of albedo-informed methods and demonstrated enhanced generalization, particularly in mountainous terrain, by effectively learning latent surface reflectance dynamics from temporal image sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed model eliminates the need for hand-crafted features and provides improved retrieval of SSR in complex environments, with publicly available code and datasets for reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Efficient Probing (EP), a parameter-efficient and computationally faster attentive probing method that outperforms traditional linear and attentive probing for evaluating self-supervised learning models, especially those trained with Masked Image Modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard linear probing inadequately captures the potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling due to the distributed nature of patch tokens, and existing attentive probing methods are computationally inefficient and over-parameterized.

Method: They propose Efficient Probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that reduces redundant projections and parameters, achieving significant speed-up over multi-head attention while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Result: EP outperforms both linear probing and prior attentive probing approaches on seven benchmarks, generalizes well across different pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and shows strong improvements in low-shot and layer-wise evaluation settings.

Conclusion: Efficient Probing provides a scalable, interpretable, and effective evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning models, addressing the shortcomings of existing probing methods with superior trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

### [109] [Improving Personalized Search with Regularized Low-Rank Parameter Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10182)
*Fiona Ryan,Josef Sivic,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Judy Hoffman,James M. Rehg,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses personalized vision-language retrieval, focusing on recognizing new personal concepts from few examples by effectively adapting a vision-language dual encoder model's language encoder with low-rank adaptation and combining multiple learned concepts. It introduces a metric to measure general knowledge preservation and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to learn new personal concepts from limited images while integrating them with general knowledge to recognize these concepts in varied contexts, which existing models struggle with.

Method: Regularized low-rank adaptation of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer is used instead of textual inversion to learn personal concepts, along with parameter addition to combine multiple concepts, and a novel metric to assess preservation of general knowledge.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi benchmarks for personalized image retrieval, outperforming previous methods by 4%-22%.

Conclusion: Low-rank adaptation of the language encoder parameters is an effective and efficient approach for personalized vision-language retrieval, maintaining general knowledge while accurately recognizing personal concepts.

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

*Parsa Rahimi,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScoreMix is a new data augmentation method that improves discriminator performance by mixing diffusion model scores from different classes to generate synthetic samples, especially effective when labeled data is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance discriminator training and performance in scenarios with limited labeled data by generating more challenging synthetic samples.

Method: Convexly mixing scores from different class-conditioned diffusion trajectories during sampling, selecting classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space for mixing.

Result: Significant improvement in discriminator capabilities across benchmarks without extensive parameter tuning, and minimal correlation between the generator's condition space and the discriminator's embedding space.

Conclusion: ScoreMix provides an effective, simple data augmentation strategy that enhances discriminative model training and reduces the need for large labeled datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a benchmark dataset and a multi-modal deep learning model for forecasting crop yields of over 70 crops across California counties from 2008 to 2022, achieving strong predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rich historical yield data, accurate and timely crop yield forecasting remains challenging due to complex environmental, climatic, and soil factors.

Method: The authors created a comprehensive benchmark dataset integrating satellite imagery, climate data, evapotranspiration, and soil properties. They developed a multi-modal deep learning model using stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to capture spatial-temporal dynamics and static inputs for long-term variations.

Result: Their model achieved an overall R2 score of 0.76 on unseen test data across all crops, demonstrating strong predictive capability across California's diverse agricultural regions.

Conclusion: This benchmark dataset and modeling framework provide a valuable foundation for improving agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation strategies, and precision farming, with the dataset and code publicly accessible.

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DySS is a camera-based 3D object detection method in Bird's Eye View that uses state-space learning and dynamic queries to improve efficiency and detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous dense BEV feature methods are costly and sparse query-based detection still requires many queries and is expensive with more video frames.

Method: DySS uses a state-space model to process sampled features sequentially over time, employs auxiliary tasks like future prediction and masked reconstruction to train the SSM, and dynamically updates queries through merge, remove, and split operations for efficient detection.

Result: DySS achieves superior detection performance on nuScenes datasets, with 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP on the test split, and 56.2 NDS, 46.2 mAP, and 33 FPS real-time speed on the validation split, outperforming the latest state of the art.

Conclusion: DySS effectively balances detection accuracy and computational efficiency by leveraging state-space learning and dynamic query updating, making it a practical solution for 3D object detection in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

*Eunkyu Park,Minyeong Kim,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HalLoc, a large dataset with 150K token-level annotations for efficient, probabilistic hallucination detection in vision-language models, enabling graded confidence detection and low-overhead integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods in vision-language models are computationally intensive and produce definitive results that do not reflect the uncertainty in real-world scenarios, reducing their practicality and efficiency.

Method: The authors created HalLoc, a dataset with detailed token-level annotations of hallucination types across various tasks (VQA, instruction-following, image captioning), and developed a baseline model trained on this dataset that can perform low-overhead, concurrent hallucination detection during generation.

Result: The baseline model trained on HalLoc can be integrated into existing vision-language models to detect hallucinations probabilistically with low computational cost, improving reliability while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: HalLoc and its associated detection model provide a practical, efficient approach to hallucination detection in vision-language models, enhancing their trustworthiness in real-world applications. The dataset and code are publicly available to support further research.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

*Hamzeh Asgharnezhad,Pegah Tabarisaadi,Abbas Khosravi,Roohallah Alizadehsani,U. Rajendra Acharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates deep learning models for skin cancer classification on the HAM10000 dataset, emphasizing both accuracy and uncertainty quantification to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity and uncertainty awareness limitations in deep learning models for skin cancer diagnosis, aiming for more accurate and trustworthy clinical predictions.

Method: They benchmark pretrained feature extractors (including CLIP, ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, EfficientNet) combined with traditional classifiers (SVM, XGBoost, logistic regression). They then apply uncertainty quantification techniques (Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout) and use uncertainty-aware metrics for evaluation.

Result: CLIP-based vision transformers with SVM performed best for classification. Ensemble methods balanced accuracy and uncertainty handling well, while Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout was more sensitive to uncertain predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating uncertainty quantification into deep learning diagnosis enhances both predictive performance and trustworthiness, which is crucial for clinical application in skin cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a weakly supervised multimodal framework to automatically generate SOAP notes for skin carcinoma from limited inputs, reducing clinician burden and annotation needs, performing comparably to leading AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating detailed SOAP notes manually is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout; current annotation requirements are high, limiting scalability.

Method: A weakly supervised multimodal approach using lesion images and sparse clinical text to generate structured SOAP notes with minimal manual annotations.

Result: The method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro on clinical relevance metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables scalable, clinically grounded documentation with reduced clinician burden and annotation needs, supported by new evaluation metrics assessing clinical quality and coherence.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limited study of audio-visual quality assessment in user-generated omnidirectional videos, constructing a dataset and a strong baseline model achieving optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growth of the Metaverse and a shift from professional to user-generated omnidirectional video content, there's a need for effective audio-visual quality assessment methods.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 300 UGC omnidirectional audio-visual videos captured by five individuals using two types of cameras across 10 scenes, conducted subjective AVQA experiments for MOS, and developed a baseline AVQA model with video and audio feature extraction and fusion modules.

Result: The baseline AVQA model demonstrated optimal performance on the newly proposed dataset, validating its effectiveness for assessing quality in UGC omnidirectional audio-visual content.

Conclusion: The constructed dataset and baseline model provide a foundation for advancing audio-visual quality assessment research in user-generated omnidirectional videos, addressing this under-explored area.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

### [117] [Using Vision Language Models to Detect Students' Academic Emotion through Facial Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10334)
*Deliang Wang,Chao Yang,Gaowei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot analysis of students' academic emotions from facial expressions in online learning, finding moderate success especially in recognizing happiness and confusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised models require extensive data collection and annotation, lack generalization across contexts. VLMs offer zero-shot prompting capability, enabling better generalization without fine-tuning, making them promising for emotion analysis in education.

Method: Employed two VLMs, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000 facial images depicting five academic emotions (confused, distracted, happy, neutral, tired) via zero-shot prompting in an online learning environment.

Result: Both models showed moderate performance, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. Both excelled at detecting happiness but failed with distraction; Qwen2.5-VL-7B was notably better at recognizing confusion.

Conclusion: VLMs hold potential for practical applications in academic emotion recognition, particularly for detecting happiness and confusion, which can aid in understanding student engagement and identifying confusing content without the need for extensive retraining.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

*Lintao Xiang,Hongpei Zheng,Yating Huang,Qijun Yang,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Point-wise Feature-Aware Gaussian Splatting framework to improve 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) rendering from sparse views, addressing overfitting and quality issues, achieving real-time high-quality results outperforming NeRF methods and competing with state-of-the-art 3DGS under few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods require many calibrated views and tend to overfit with sparse views, causing poor rendering quality. There's a need to enable high-quality, real-time rendering from limited input views.

Method: Uses a stereo foundation model for camera pose estimation and dense point cloud reconstruction for initialization; encodes color attributes by aggregating multiscale 2D features from sparse inputs; employs a self-attention-based point interaction network for enhanced feature representation; decodes features into Gaussian parameters via lightweight MLPs for rendering.

Result: The method significantly surpasses NeRF-based approaches in rendering quality and speed and maintains competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art 3DGS methods in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables high-quality, real-time 3DGS rendering from sparse views, effectively overcoming limitations of existing methods and offering a strong alternative under sparse input conditions.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

*Zhanwei Zhang,Kaiyuan Liu,Junjie Liu,Wenxiao Wang,Binbin Lin,Liang Xie,Chen Shen,Deng Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoCAD is a method for local geometry-controllable CAD generation that modifies specific local parts of CAD models based on user-defined geometric instructions, improving design efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD generation methods either fail to incorporate textual instructions effectively or lack the ability to target local parts for modification, limiting design flexibility and control.

Method: GeoCAD uses a complementary captioning strategy combining vertex-based and large language model (VLLM)-based captioning to generate geometric instructions for local parts. During training, local parts are randomly masked and predicted using geometric instructions and remaining parts via LLMs. Users can specify any local part and predefined geometric instructions for modification during inference.

Result: GeoCAD was trained on about 221,000 local parts and demonstrated high generation quality, validity, and consistency between text instructions and generated CAD models in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: GeoCAD effectively enhances local geometry-controllable CAD generation by enabling precise, user-guided modifications of local parts, improving design efficiency and flexibility with strong adherence to geometric instructions.

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision-language-model-based framework for automated, scalable analysis of urban streetscape styles, demonstrated on Beijing and Shenzhen, with a curated dataset and validated results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional urban cultural studies reliant on expert interpretation and historical records, which lack standardization and scalability.

Method: Development of UrbanDiffBench dataset and UrbanSense framework using vision-language models for quantitative generation and comparison of urban architectural style representations.

Result: Over 80% of generated descriptions statistically significant (p < 0.05) with high subjective evaluation scores (Phi: 0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) confirming the framework's capability to capture subtle stylistic differences.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an objective, data-driven approach to analyze and interpret urban style evolution, enhancing future urban design and cultural studies.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

*Mina C. Moghadam,Alan Q. Wang,Omer Taub,Martin R. Prince,Mert R. Sabuncu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic medical image registration method that avoids resampling artifacts by operating in real-world scanner coordinates, improving registration for images with differing resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning registration methods resample images to a fixed resolution, causing interpolation artifacts, which is suboptimal for medical images with varying acquisition parameters.

Method: RKM extends KeyMorph by outputting keypoints in real-world coordinates derived from the scanner's affine matrix, allowing keypoint matching and registration without resampling images.

Result: Experiments on abdominal MRI 2D stacks and 3D brain volumes with varying resolutions show that RKM effectively handles resolution differences and improves registration performance.

Conclusion: RKM enables resolution-agnostic registration by leveraging scanner coordinate systems, avoiding interpolation artifacts and enhancing registration quality across different image resolutions.

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

*Runqi Ouyang,Haoyun Li,Zhenyuan Zhang,Xiaofeng Wang,Zheng Zhu,Guan Huang,Xingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-R1 is a text-to-motion generation framework that uses a Chain-of-Thought mechanism to improve semantic understanding and motion synthesis, addressing issues of controllability, consistency, and diversity in generated motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-motion generation methods struggle with deep linguistic structures and logical reasoning, leading to poor controllability, consistency, and diversity in generated motions.

Method: Motion-R1 integrates Chain-of-Thought to decompose complex textual instructions into structured action paths, coupled with Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning technique to optimize reasoning and motion synthesis.

Result: Motion-R1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks, especially in tasks requiring detailed semantic understanding and maintaining long-term temporal coherence.

Conclusion: Incorporating logical decomposition and reinforcement learning in text-to-motion generation enhances the model's ability to handle complex instructions and produce high-quality, consistent motions.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui,Yuhan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes FSATFusion, an end-to-end network for infrared and visible image fusion using a Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer to effectively capture features and global context, showing superior performance and generalization in experiments and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for infrared and visible image fusion use convolutions which struggle to capture global context, resulting in information loss and limited fusion quality.

Method: The paper introduces FSATFusion incorporating a Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer (FSAT) module with a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) and an improved Transformer module (ITM) to better extract both significant features and global context from source images.

Result: Experiments demonstrate FSATFusion achieves superior fusion quality and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art methods, generalizes well to other tasks without modification, and improves performance in object detection downstream tasks.

Conclusion: FSATFusion effectively overcomes convolutional limitations for image fusion by leveraging frequency-spatial attention and improved Transformer modules, leading to enhanced fusion quality, efficiency, and broad applicability in visual tasks.

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

*Laziz U. Abdullaev,Maksim Tkachenko,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a unifying image processing framework to interpret self-attention and its components in Transformer architectures, proposing two new modifications that improve both interpretability and performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention mechanisms in Transformers are highly effective but remain heuristic and challenging to interpret, motivating a need for a robust theoretical foundation to explain their success and limitations.

Method: The authors create a unifying framework based on image processing principles to explain self-attention, positional encoding, residual connections, and their variants, and introduce two architectural modifications inspired by this framework.

Result: The proposed modifications, besides enhancing interpretability, empirically improve accuracy, robustness to data contamination and adversarial attacks, and long sequence understanding in both language and vision tasks.

Conclusion: Establishing an image processing perspective provides deeper insight into self-attention and its components, enabling design improvements that boost both interpretability and practical performance in Transformers.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

*Jerry Yan,Chinmay Talegaonkar,Nicholas Antipa,Eric Terrill,Sophia Merrifield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseIDON, a computer vision pipeline, estimates the burial depth of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor using ROV video by combining deep learning and photogrammetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve burial depth estimation of seafloor objects for ecological risk assessment, pollutant transport understanding, and mitigation planning despite challenges like occlusion and poor visibility.

Method: PoseIDON uses deep foundation model features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate object pose and seafloor orientation, aligning CAD models with imagery to infer burial depth via a local planar seafloor approximation.

Result: Validated on 54 objects from a historic dumpsite, PoseIDON achieved a mean burial depth error of ~10 cm and captured spatial burial patterns linked to sediment transport processes.

Conclusion: The method provides scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor object burial aiding environmental assessment at contamination sites.

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

*Shicheng Yin,Kaixuan Yin,Yang Liu,Weixing Chen,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DART, a dynamic tokenizer that adaptively partitions images into varying patch sizes to improve vision transformer models by focusing more on information-rich areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing non-convolutional models use fixed-size patches that encode excessive background and miss crucial local details, especially with sparsely distributed informative objects.

Method: DART uses learnable region scores and piecewise differentiable quantile operations to generate content-dependent patches, allocating more tokens to information-rich regions with only about 1M additional parameters.

Result: DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K), reduces FLOPs by 45%, and consistently enhances accuracy across DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba with minimal or reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: DART efficiently improves vision transformer performance by adaptively tokenizing images, offering superior accuracy and computational savings compared to fixed or uniformly dense tokenization methods.

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

*Yuanyi Song,Pumeng Lyu,Ben Fei,Fenghua Ling,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReconMOST is a data-driven diffusion model framework for reconstructing multi-layer ocean temperature globally, handling sparse data, cloud occlusion, and maintaining accuracy and resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ocean temperature reconstruction methods face challenges such as sparse data, complex algorithms, high costs, and limited machine learning applications mostly restricted to surface or local areas, struggling with cloud occlusion and missing data.

Method: Pre-train an unconditional diffusion model on large-scale historical numerical simulation data to learn physically consistent temperature patterns; during reconstruction, use sparse yet accurate in-situ data as guidance for reverse diffusion, enabling plausible temperature field reconstruction even in data-sparse regions.

Result: The model successfully handles over 92.5% missing data, achieves low mean squared error values (0.049 guidance, 0.680 reconstruction, 0.633 total), and demonstrates superior generalization and reconstruction accuracy on CMIP6 and EN4 datasets.

Conclusion: ReconMOST effectively extends machine learning-based SST reconstruction to a global, multi-layer level with robustness and superior performance, providing a promising tool for climate and marine meteorological research.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

TL;DR: Pisces is a unified multimodal model achieving strong performance in both image understanding and generation with a novel architecture and tailored training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified models often underperform specialized models due to different visual features and training needs for image understanding and generation.

Method: Pisces employs a decoupled visual encoding architecture and specialized training strategies, alongside careful data curation, pretraining, and finetuning.

Result: Pisces performs competitively on over 20 image understanding benchmarks and the GenEval image generation benchmark, showing robust capabilities in both tasks.

Conclusion: Decoupling visual encoders and using tailored training enhances unified multimodal models, demonstrating synergy between image understanding and generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

*Guoyi Zhang,Guangsheng Xu,Siyang Chen,Han Wang,Xiaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRRNet is an end-to-end deep learning framework for infrared small target detection that leverages the low-rank property of infrared backgrounds using a compression--reconstruction--subtraction paradigm, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection is challenging due to low signal-to-clutter ratios, target variability, and lack of clear visual cues, causing instability in recent deep learning methods.

Method: LRRNet models low-rank background structures directly in the image domain through a novel compression--reconstruction--subtraction approach, avoiding patch-based or matrix decomposition techniques, and learns this end-to-end with deep neural networks.

Result: Extensive experiments show LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets in accuracy, robustness, and speed, running at 82.34 FPS, and is robust to sensor noise.

Conclusion: The proposed LRRNet framework effectively captures low-rank background structures to improve infrared small target detection, setting new performance standards with real-time capability and noise resilience.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MF2Summ is a multimodal video summarization model integrating visual and auditory features through advanced Transformer-based fusion, achieving improved performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video summarization methods relying on a single modality fail to capture the full semantic content of videos, motivating the creation of a model that integrates multiple modalities for richer understanding.

Method: MF2Summ uses a five-stage process: extracting visual features via GoogLeNet, auditory features via SoundNet, employing cross-modal and self-attention Transformers for feature fusion and alignment, predicting segment importance and location, and selecting key shots using NMS and KTS techniques.

Result: On SumMe and TVSum datasets, MF2Summ improves F1-scores by 1.9% and 0.6% respectively over the DSNet baseline and performs competitively with other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Integrating visual and auditory data through Transformer-based fusion effectively enhances video summarization quality, demonstrating MF2Summ as a strong multimodal summarization approach.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIDer is a robust framework for Multimodal Emotion Recognition that addresses modality missing and OOD data challenges with fewer parameters and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER methods struggle simultaneously with missing modalities and OOD data, often requiring complex or bulky models, limiting practical use.

Method: CIDer combines Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) with a Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) module, including modules like WSAM for efficiency and MCM for causal bias reduction, plus a new RMFM task and OOD datasets.

Result: CIDer shows robust performance on RMFM and OOD tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters and quicker training.

Conclusion: CIDer effectively enhances robustness and generalization in MER with a lightweight, efficient framework addressing both modality missing and OOD issues.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

*Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Jie Chen,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Implicit Motion Transformation (IMT) to improve generative human video coding (GHVC) for complex human body videos by converting compact visual features into implicit motion guidance, enhancing compression efficiency and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional generative video codecs perform well in face video compression but struggle with complex and diverse motions in human body videos, leading to distortions and inaccurate motion when using explicit motion guidance.

Method: The paper introduces an Implicit Motion Transformation (IMT) approach that encodes complex human body signals into compact visual features and transforms these into implicit motion guidance to aid in signal reconstruction during compression.

Result: Experimental results show that the IMT paradigm effectively enhances GHVC, achieving both high-efficiency compression and high-fidelity synthesis for human body videos.

Conclusion: IMT overcomes limitations of explicit motion-based methods in human body video compression, making GHVC more efficient and producing more accurate reconstructed videos.

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

*Chun Liu,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zheng Zheng,Zheng Li,Wei Yang,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method to improve the transferability of adversarial attacks on hyperspectral image classification models by leveraging block-wise transformations and a feature distancing loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images differ significantly from natural images, and existing adversarial attack methods do not fully exploit their high-dimensional spectral and structural information, limiting transferability of adversarial examples.

Method: The method involves randomly dividing HSIs into blocks along spatial and spectral dimensions, applying diverse transformations to increase input variability and reduce overfitting. Additionally, a feature distancing loss targeting intermediate neural network layers is designed to guide perturbations, disrupting true class features and enhancing transferability.

Result: Experiments on two public hyperspectral image datasets show that the generated adversarial examples effectively transfer to black-box models and maintain robust attack performance under defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances the transferability and robustness of adversarial attacks for hyperspectral image classifiers, addressing challenges unique to HSIs and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

Motivation: While quantization techniques improve the efficiency and robustness of DNNs, little research has focused on how initial weight initialization affects quantization robustness. Understanding this could enhance model performance post-quantization.

Method: The authors performed an extensive empirical analysis of various weight initializations across CNN architectures and proposed a new initialization method using Graph Hypernetworks (GHN) to predict quantized DNN parameters, including a finetuned version called GHN-QAT for further accuracy gains.

Result: The GHN-predicted parameters demonstrated enhanced quantization robustness, with GHN-QAT yielding significant accuracy improvements even at 4-bit quantization and maintaining better-than-random accuracy at 2-bit levels.

Conclusion: This study is the first to deeply analyze weight initialization effects on quantized DNNs and introduces GHN-QAT as a novel tool to improve low-bit quantized model accuracy, opening avenues for future research to optimize quantization-aware training further.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Yichen Zhao,Piao Yang,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSeg-R is a novel framework that uses multimodal large language models to interpret complex medical instructions and generate precise segmentation masks for medical images, supported by a new large-scale dataset MedSeg-QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation methods rely heavily on explicit human instructions and lack reasoning capabilities to handle complex clinical questions, limiting their use in automatic diagnosis.

Method: MedSeg-R integrates a global context understanding module for interpreting images and complex instructions, and a pixel-level grounding module to generate accurate segmentation masks and textual responses. Additionally, MedSeg-QA dataset was created with over 10,000 image-mask pairs and multi-turn conversations.

Result: MedSeg-R outperforms existing methods in segmentation accuracy and provides interpretable textual analysis across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedSeg-R advances medical image segmentation by enabling reasoning-based mask generation from complex instructions, showing promise for automatic and interpretable medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical
images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates vision-language models (VLMs) for deepfake detection, finding they are not yet reliable standalone detectors but useful for interpretability and augmenting human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges posed by sophisticated deepfakes and explore the potential of emerging vision-language models in detecting them.

Method: Zero-shot structured evaluation of four VLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) against a diverse benchmark of authentic and manipulated images covering faceswap, reenactment, and synthetic generation deepfakes, measuring classification accuracy and reasoning capabilities.

Result: VLMs can detect surface-level anomalies and provide coherent explanations but suffer from biases like overemphasis on stylistic features and susceptibility to misleading visuals, limiting their standalone detection reliability.

Conclusion: While not yet dependable for autonomous deepfake detection, VLMs offer valuable interpretability and contextual reasoning, making them promising tools to support human expertise in hybrid forensic detection workflows.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset for Optical Music Recognition (OMR) research, and a new evaluation metric OMR-NED that provides detailed error analysis on musical notation elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a standardized, comprehensive benchmark dataset and evaluation metric tailored for Optical Music Recognition, facilitating better comparison and development of OMR methods.

Method: The authors create SMB, a diverse dataset of 685 pages of sheet music encoded in Humdrum **kern format across various musical textures. They propose OMR-NED, a metric based on Symbol Error Rate but with finer granularity on musical notation errors. Baseline experiments with existing state-of-the-art OMR methods on SMB demonstrate the utility of the dataset and metric.

Result: The SMB dataset enables robust benchmarking with diverse musical textures. OMR-NED offers detailed error analysis for individual notation elements, improving evaluation clarity and enabling objective comparison of OMR approaches. Baseline results validate the dataset and metric effectiveness.

Conclusion: SMB and OMR-NED fill a critical gap in OMR research by providing a comprehensive dataset and a fine-grained evaluation metric, advancing standardization and enabling improved OMR system development and assessment.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical
textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

*Guyang Zhang,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of distinguishing botanical origins of honey using class-incremental learning (CIL) on hyperspectral imaging data, proposing a continual backpropagation (CB) method to improve CIL performance by reinitializing less active neurons, achieving 1-7% better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate and effective botanical origin identification of honey without requiring simultaneous collection of all honey varieties for training, thus protecting consumer interests.

Method: Comparison of multiple CIL algorithms on a honey hyperspectral imaging dataset, and introducing a novel continual backpropagation (CB) algorithm that reinitializes less-used hidden neurons to reduce loss of plasticity in neural networks.

Result: The CB method improved the performance of most tested CIL algorithms by 1-7%, demonstrating enhanced accuracy in botanical origin classification.

Conclusion: Incorporating continual backpropagation into class-incremental learning significantly benefits botanical origin differentiation of honey, offering a practical solution for real-world honey classification challenges.

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PSLG-SAM, a two-stage framework for Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation that improves segmentation accuracy while reducing annotation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for RRSIS require dense annotations and struggle with complex scenes, creating challenges in efficient and precise segmentation.

Method: PSLG-SAM decomposes RRSIS into coarse localization via a visual grounding network and fine segmentation using the Segment Anything Model guided by coordinates and optimized with clustering and mask boundary techniques; the fine segmentation stage can be conducted without training.

Result: The framework shows significant performance improvements over existing methods on two datasets, demonstrating better accuracy and efficiency in segmenting specified objects from remote sensing images.

Conclusion: By splitting the task into two stages and leveraging a train-free fine segmentation model, PSLG-SAM reduces annotation burden and improves segmentation quality, advancing the state-of-the-art in RRSIS.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper presents J-DDL, a smart system combining 2D image and 3D point cloud data for efficient and precise surface damage detection and localization on fighter aircraft.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of fighter aircraft for surface defects is limited by scalability, efficiency, and consistency issues due to the aircraft's large and complex surface structure.

Method: J-DDL uses a novel YOLO-based damage detection network enhanced with lightweight Fasternet blocks, Efficient Multiscale Attention modules, and a new loss function (Inner-CIOU) to detect defects in 2D images, which are then mapped to 3D point clouds for accurate localization.

Result: Experimental results confirm J-DDL's effectiveness in improving inspection coverage and accuracy, demonstrating its ability to streamline and automate aircraft surface damage detection.

Conclusion: J-DDL offers a significant advancement in automated aircraft inspection technology, delivering comprehensive damage detection and localization, supported by the first public dataset dedicated to aircraft damage.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CogReasoner effectively manages the streaming video reasoning task by focusing on relevant context while reducing computational requirements.

Conclusion: CogStream and CogReasoner advance streaming video reasoning by tackling efficiency and relevance of contextual information, providing a valuable resource and baseline for future research.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be

*Imanol Solano,Julian Fierrez,Aythami Morales,Alejandro Peña,Ruben Tolosana,Francisco Zamora-Martinez,Javier San Agustin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a new metric for detecting demographic bias in face recognition systems, focusing on subtle disparities in score distribution tails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to detect subtle biases in the tails of score distributions in high-performance face recognition systems.

Method: CEI analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, allowing configurable emphasis on tail probabilities and overall distribution shapes; CEI^A is an automated version for ease of use.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art, biased models, and diverse datasets demonstrate CEI's superior sensitivity in detecting nuanced biases where previous metrics fail.

Conclusion: CEI is a robust and sensitive tool for fairness assessment in face biometrics, with applicability to any problem involving statistical distribution comparisons focusing on tails.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Result: LRSLAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in parameter efficiency, processing time, and accuracy on indoor RGB-D datasets while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: Low-rank tensor decomposition in LRSLAM effectively improves performance and efficiency for large-scale dense visual SLAM tasks.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has been crucial across various

Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces
challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for
large-scale scenes. Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene
representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and
memory requirements. ESLAM introduced a plane-based tensor decomposition but
still struggled with memory growth. Addressing these challenges, we propose a
more efficient visual SLAM model, called LRSLAM, utilizing low-rank tensor

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to maintain identities of humans and products or lack proper understanding of their spatial interactions, resulting in unrealistic videos.

Method: The proposed DiT framework injects paired human-product references, uses masked cross-attention, 3D body mesh templates, product bounding boxes, and structured text encoding for better motion alignment and identity preservation.

Result: The approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by preserving identity integrity and creating realistic demonstration motions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos with realistic interactions and consistent identities, advancing e-commerce product presentation.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational

### [150] [Improving Medical Visual Representation Learning with Pathological-level Cross-Modal Alignment and Correlation Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10573)
*Jun Wang,Lixing Zhu,Xiaohan Yu,Abhir Bhalerao,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PLACE, a framework that improves medical image-report learning by aligning pathological details across images and reports and exploring correlations to enrich fine-grained features, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in learning medical visual representations from lengthy, complex medical reports by focusing on pathological-level consistency beyond simple instance or token alignment.

Method: PLACE employs a pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) that extracts visual pathology observations and aligns them with report data without extra annotations, plus a proxy task that encourages fine-grained correlation discovery among image patches.

Result: PLACE achieves superior performance across multiple downstream medical tasks including classification, image-to-text retrieval, segmentation, object detection, and report generation, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Pathological-level alignment and correlation exploration significantly enhance medical image-report learning, improving model robustness and generalizability without requiring additional annotations.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

### [151] [DanceChat: Large Language Model-Guided Music-to-Dance Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10574)
*Qing Wang,Xiaohang Yang,Yilan Dong,Naveen Raj Govindaraj,Gregory Slabaugh,Shanxin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DanceChat is a music-to-dance generation approach that uses a Large Language Model to provide textual choreography instructions, enhancing diversity and alignment of generated dances with music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges in music-to-dance generation arise from the abstract nature of music cues and the one-to-many mapping between music and possible dances, compounded by limited paired music-dance data.

Method: DanceChat uses (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generator for textual dance guidance, (2) a multi-modal feature fusion module combining music, rhythm, and text, and (3) a diffusion-based motion synthesis module with alignment loss to generate dance movements.

Result: Experiments on AIST++ dataset and human evaluations demonstrate that DanceChat generates dances that are more diverse and align better with music styles than previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating LLM-generated textual choreography guidance significantly improves the quality and diversity of music-conditioned dance generation, addressing key challenges in this field.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Chun-Mei Feng,Kai Yu,Xinxing Xu,Salman Khan,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Wangmeng Zuo,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I-PAL improves multi-label image recognition by using text-to-image models to generate images from captions, reducing the modality gap in CLIP-based fine-tuning and enhancing performance with class-wise heatmaps and prompt tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap between image and text features in pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP limits image recognition performance when using text-only fine-tuning.

Method: T2I-PAL uses text-to-image generation to create diverse images from text captions, incorporates class-wise heatmaps and learnable prototypes to enhance local feature representation, and applies both prompt tuning and adapter learning for better fine-tuning.

Result: T2I-PAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by boosting multi-label recognition performance on benchmarks like MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE by an average of 3.47%.

Conclusion: By leveraging generated images from captions and combining advanced fine-tuning techniques, T2I-PAL effectively reduces the modality gap and improves multi-label image recognition without extensive annotations, integrating seamlessly with existing CLIP models.

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

### [153] [Harmonizing Geometry and Uncertainty: Diffusion with Hyperspheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10576)
*Muskan Dosi,Chiranjeev Chiranjeev,Kartik Thakral,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines how standard diffusion models fail to preserve the geometric properties of hyperspherical data due to their reliance on Gaussian noise suited for Euclidean space. It proposes HyperSphereDiff, a model using directional noise aligned with hyperspherical geometry, resulting in better generative accuracy and preservation of angular class structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models use isotropic Gaussian noise favoring Euclidean spaces, which leads to loss of angular features in hyperspherical data, degrading performance in real-world tasks involving non-Euclidean distributions.

Method: Introduction of HyperSphereDiff that employs directional noise aligned with hyperspherical geometry to preserve class geometry and accurately capture angular uncertainty in the generative process.

Result: Both theoretical and empirical evidence show HyperSphereDiff better matches the intrinsic geometry of hyperspherical data, achieving improved generative modeling on four object and two face datasets

Conclusion: Incorporating angular uncertainty via directional noise preserves hyperspherical manifold structures, enhancing the accuracy and geometry-awareness of diffusion-based generative models for hyperspherical data.

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

### [154] [Rethinking Random Masking in Self Distillation on ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10582)
*Jihyeon Seong,Hyunkyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of random masking in the self-distillation framework DINO for Vision Transformers to improve performance and robustness by applying random masking selectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking in self-distillation frameworks like DINO can eliminate important semantic information, so more informed masking strategies are needed to preserve crucial features while improving training.

Method: Random masking is applied only to the student's global view, while the student's local views and teacher's global view remain unmasked, leveraging DINO's multi-view augmentation to maintain clean supervision with robust masked inputs.

Result: Experiments with DINO-Tiny on mini-ImageNet show that this asymmetric random masking approach produces more robust, fine-grained attention maps and enhances downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Selective random masking in self-distillation frameworks enhances Vision Transformer robustness and effectiveness by preserving critical semantic information and improving training regularization.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

*Jin Huang,Honghua Chen,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents HEA-MM, a hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models using structured light scanning and multi-level analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure high quality in aviation equipment by accurately assessing manufacturing errors in aircraft CAD models at multiple hierarchical levels.

Method: HEA-MM uses structured light scanners to capture 3D measurements, registering point clouds with CAD models and analyzing errors globally, by part (using a novel primitive refinement with splitting and merging), and at the feature level (detecting circular holes via a two-stage tensor-voting and hypothesize-and-clusterize algorithm).

Result: The framework effectively identifies deviations at global, part, and feature levels in various aircraft CAD models, as demonstrated experimentally.

Conclusion: HEA-MM provides a comprehensive and effective approach for hierarchical error assessment in aircraft manufacturing, enhancing quality control through detailed multi-level error analysis.

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

*Xinyuan Liu,Hang Xu,Yike Ma,Yucheng Zhang,Feng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SSP, a framework for oriented object detection in dense remote sensing images using point supervision, improving sample assignment and box extraction with spatial and semantic partitions, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the labor-intensive annotation in dense remote sensing scenes and limitations in existing point supervised methods caused by rigid rule-based sample assignment and instance confusion.

Method: SSP uses pixel-level spatial partitioning to assign samples by estimating object scale bounds and mining positive and hard negative samples, and semantic spatial partitioning to extract object instances from semantic maps into bounding boxes as pseudo-labels for training.

Result: SSP achieves 45.78% mAP on DOTA-v1.0 under point supervision, surpassing the previous best PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%, and further improves performance to 47.86% and 48.50% mAP when combined with ORCNN and ReDet architectures.

Conclusion: SSP effectively balances rule-based prior knowledge and data-driven purification, significantly enhancing point-supervised oriented object detection performance in dense remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is
available at https://github.com/antxinyuan/ssp.

TL;DR: LatentCSI generates high-quality images from WiFi CSI data using a lightweight neural network and pretrained latent diffusion models, outperforming comparable methods in efficiency and quality, and allowing text-guided control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve image generation from WiFi CSI by reducing computational complexity and enhancing image quality with a novel, efficient approach.

Method: Map CSI amplitudes to the latent space of a pretrained latent diffusion model using a lightweight neural network, apply text-guided denoising diffusion, then decode to generate high-resolution images without explicit pixel-space encoding.

Result: Validated on two datasets, LatentCSI outperforms similar-complexity baselines in computational efficiency and perceptual image quality, and enables unique text-guided control of image synthesis.

Conclusion: LatentCSI demonstrates that leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models with lightweight neural network mapping provides an efficient, high-quality, and controllable solution for WiFi CSI-based image generation, surpassing conventional methods.

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

*Liang Yin,Xudong Xie,Zhang Li,Xiang Bai,Yuliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSTAR is a box-free method for scene text retrieval that eliminates bounding box annotation costs, supports multiple query types, and improves performance over previous models on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene text retrieval methods require expensive bounding box annotations and struggle to unify diverse query types in retrieval tasks.

Method: MSTAR uses progressive vision embedding for multi-grained text representation, style-aware instructions for free-style text queries, and a multi-instance matching module for better vision-language alignment. It also introduces the MQTR dataset for evaluating multi-query retrieval.

Result: MSTAR outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text and by 8.5% on the MQTR benchmark, while avoiding bounding box annotations.

Conclusion: MSTAR effectively addresses the high annotation cost and query type diversity issues in scene text retrieval, achieving superior performance without relying on bounding box annotations.

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

### [159] [TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10612)
*Suin Lee,Dae-Shik Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TexTailor is a new method for generating consistent object textures from text, improving over existing methods by integrating previously synthesized textures during diffusion and adaptively selecting camera viewpoints based on object geometry to enhance texture consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-texture synthesis methods produce texture inconsistencies across viewpoints due to poor integration of prior textures during synthesis and fixed camera positions that ignore object geometry.

Method: TexTailor applies a resampling scheme to integrate previous texture information during diffusion, fine-tunes a depth-aware diffusion model with a proposed performance preservation loss to maintain image fidelity, and adaptively adjusts camera positions based on object geometry.

Result: Experiments on Objaverse and ShapeNet car datasets show that TexTailor outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in generating view-consistent textures.

Conclusion: TexTailor effectively improves view-consistent text-to-texture synthesis by addressing texture integration and viewpoint selection issues, resulting in superior texture consistency across multiple views.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of aligning text and image data in chest X-rays using Latent Diffusion Models, proposing a fine-tuning method to improve alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models have been effective in natural images but are underexplored in medical imaging due to data scarcity and privacy issues. The authors aim to improve the multi-modal alignment between radiology reports and chest X-ray images.

Method: They propose a fine-tuning framework for a pre-trained text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model to enhance alignment between free-text radiology reports and corresponding chest X-ray areas, enabling efficient use for tasks like phrase grounding.

Result: The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MS-CXR benchmark and shows robust results on out-of-distribution datasets such as VinDr-CXR.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models improves clinical relevance and multi-modal alignment in chest X-ray analysis, making these models more effective for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: SymmFlow is a novel framework unifying semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation via bi-directional flow matching, achieving state-of-the-art synthesis and competitive segmentation and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified model that integrates semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation with consistent, efficient, and semantically meaningful transformations between distributions.

Method: SymmFlow employs a symmetric learning objective modeling forward and reverse flows jointly, maintains entropy for diversity, introduces a training objective preserving semantic information, and allows one-step segmentation and classification through flexible conditioning.

Result: SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art semantic image synthesis (FID 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ, 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with 25 steps), competitive semantic segmentation, and promising classification performance.

Conclusion: SymmFlow successfully unifies multiple tasks in a single generative framework with efficient inference and preserves semantic consistency, setting new benchmarks and enabling future research with publicly available code.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation fine-tuning methods rely heavily on human annotations and large computational resources, limiting their practicality and efficiency.

Method: GigaVideo-1 employs a prompt-driven data engine to create diverse, weakness-oriented training samples and uses a reward-guided training strategy with feedback from pre-trained vision-language models and realism constraints for adaptive sample weighting.

Result: GigaVideo-1 improves video generation performance across 17 evaluation dimensions on the VBench-2.0 benchmark with an average improvement of about 4%, requiring only 4 GPU-hours and no manual annotations.

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1 effectively and efficiently enhances pre-trained video diffusion models for better video generation quality without additional human supervision or large-scale data, demonstrating practical utility and scalability.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

TL;DR: PiPViT is a vision transformer-based prototype learning model for medical image classification, achieving competitive accuracy and improved interpretability through human-understandable prototypes and multi-resolution processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based methods produce overly granular and less interpretable prototypes in medical imaging, which hinders clinical understanding of biomarker presence and lesion extent.

Method: PiPViT uses a vision transformer to capture long-range patch dependencies, learns prototypes representing lesion extents from image-level labels, and incorporates contrastive learning and multi-resolution inputs for better biomarker localization.

Result: PiPViT achieves competitive classification performance on retinal OCT datasets and provides clinically and semantically relevant, meaningful explanations through its learned prototypes.

Conclusion: PiPViT enhances transparency and interpretability in medical image classification, aiding clinicians by offering explanations aligned with clinical biomarkers and lesion characteristics.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

*Subhram Dasgupta,Janelle Mason,Xiaohong Yuan,Olusola Odeyomi,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight CNN with squeeze and excitation block attention for efficient and accurate Deepfake detection, achieving 94.14% accuracy and 0.985 AUC-ROC on Style GAN dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes using advanced AI pose serious challenges for information authenticity, and existing detection models tend to be large and resource-intensive.

Method: The authors design a CNN incorporating SE blocks that perform dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration, enabling the model to emphasize relevant features and suppress less useful ones, integrated into a simple sequential model.

Result: The proposed lightweight model achieves a classification accuracy of 94.14% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on a Style GAN dataset, demonstrating competitive performance with significantly reduced size.

Conclusion: The model offers a promising, efficient, and scalable solution for Deepfake detection, effectively addressing computational resource constraints while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

*Xia Du,Xiaoyuan Liu,Jizhe Zhou,Zheng Lin,Chi-man Pun,Zhe Chen,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC) framework to generate high-fidelity adversarial CAPTCHAs guided by text prompts, improving attack success and diversity while preserving human interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHAs are increasingly vulnerable to DNN-powered automated attacks, and existing adversarial methods either distort images or require original inputs, limiting effectiveness and usability.

Method: UAC leverages a Large Language Model for diverse CAPTCHA generation, uses the EDICT method to optimize latent variables for targeted attacks, and introduces BP-UAC, a bi-path two-step optimization strategy utilizing multimodal gradients for untargeted, black-box attacks.

Result: BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates on various systems and produces natural-looking CAPTCHAs that are indistinguishable to both humans and deep neural networks.

Conclusion: The proposed UAC framework effectively generates adversarial CAPTCHAs that are robust against deep learning attacks while maintaining human readability and applicability in scenarios without original images.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

### [166] [Underage Detection through a Multi-Task and MultiAge Approach for Screening Minors in Unconstrained Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10689)
*Christopher Gaul,Eduardo Fidalgo,Enrique Alegre,Rocío Alaiz Rodríguez,Eri Pérez Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust multi-task model using a frozen vision-language backbone and specialized age discrimination heads to improve minor screening in images, addressing data imbalance and distribution shifts, validated by a new comprehensive benchmark dataset, achieving significant accuracy and generalization improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop accurate automatic screening models for minors that can handle data imbalance and distribution shifts in unconstrained images, especially focusing on legally critical age thresholds.

Method: A multi-task architecture combining a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone with a two-layer MLP, featuring one age-regression head and four binary under-age heads for ages 12, 15, 18, and 21, using $alpha$-reweighted focal loss, age-balanced mini-batch sampling, and an age gap technique, evaluated on a new benchmark with cleaned and challenging test sets.

Result: The proposed model reduces RMSE on a clean test set and significantly improves under-age detection F2 scores at multiple age thresholds, maintaining high recall and better performance under distribution shifts and challenging conditions compared to age-only baselines.

Conclusion: The multi-task approach with specialized losses and balanced sampling robustly addresses age estimation biases and distribution shifts, achieving strong generalization in minor screening, validated by a rigorously constructed benchmark.

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

*Melika Ayoughi,Mina Ghadimi Atigh,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Cees G. M. Snoek,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a continual learning task involving simultaneous learning of instances and classes, proposing HyperCLIC, a hyperbolic space-based algorithm that models hierarchical class-instance structures, showing improved performance on hierarchical generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like robotics require models to learn and adapt to both fine-grained instances and coarse-grained classes simultaneously, challenging current continual learning methods.

Method: The authors propose HyperCLIC, which leverages hyperbolic space to model hierarchical relationships via hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives, enabling continual embedding of hierarchical data.

Result: Empirical validation on the EgoObjects dataset demonstrates that HyperCLIC effectively handles multiple granularities and improves hierarchical generalization compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HyperCLIC successfully addresses the continual learning challenge of simultaneous instance and class recognition by exploiting hyperbolic geometry to model hierarchical data, enhancing performance in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

### [168] [Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion for Camouflaged Object Detection Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10712)
*Yuqi Shen,Fengyang Xiao,Sujie Hu,Youwei Pang,Yifan Pu,Chengyu Fang,Xiu Li,Chunming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UMBD, a novel generative refinement model for camouflaged object detection that selectively refines uncertain segments using Bernoulli diffusion guided by a hybrid uncertainty quantification network, improving segmentation accuracy with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camouflaged object detection methods lack effective post-processing refinement to enhance segmentation quality where subtle differences between objects and backgrounds cause errors.

Method: UMBD applies uncertainty-guided Bernoulli diffusion selectively to poorly segmented areas, supported by HUQNet which fuses multi-source uncertainty estimations to guide adaptive generative sampling; it integrates with existing COD encoder-decoder models for refinement.

Result: UMBD consistently improves performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving average improvements of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only a slight increase in computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed UMBD framework effectively enhances COD performance by targeted generative refinement based on reliable uncertainty estimation, showing promising results for post-processing enhancement in COD tasks.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning method to generate synthetic golden standard wafer images for InP semiconductor manufacturing, improving defect detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In Indium-Phosphide multi-project wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability result in a lack of golden standards, making defect detection manual and labor-intensive.

Method: They use Deep Neural Networks to simulate photo-realistic wafer images from CAD data, exploring various training objectives and evaluating image quality.

Result: The deep learning approach outperforms a baseline decision-tree method, enabling a simulated golden die for template matching and more efficient defect detection.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates practical utility in automated surface defect detection, overcoming challenges of unavailable golden standards in InP wafer manufacturing.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

*Hong Huang,Weixiang Sun,Zhijian Wu,Jingwen Niu,Donghuan Lu,Xian Wu,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IQE-CLIP improves zero- and few-shot anomaly detection in medical imaging by integrating text and instance-aware visual information into query embeddings, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based anomaly detection methods assume known categories, rely on scenario-specific prompts, and perform poorly distinguishing anomalies in joint embedding space, especially in medical applications where exploration is limited.

Method: IQE-CLIP introduces class-based and learnable prompting tokens tailored for medical imagery and an instance-aware query module that captures region-level contextual information from both visual and textual modalities to create anomaly-sensitive embeddings.

Result: Experiments on six medical datasets show IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art zero- and few-shot anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: Integrating instance-aware visual cues with adaptable text prompts in query embeddings effectively enhances anomaly detection in medical domains, expanding the applicability of vision-language models like CLIP beyond industrial settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PosterCraft is a unified framework for generating high-quality aesthetic posters by optimizing text rendering and layout design through a cascaded workflow and large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than designing simple images because it requires precise text rendering, artistic content integration, harmonious layouts, and stylistic consistency.

Method: PosterCraft employs a multi-stage cascaded workflow including large-scale text-rendering optimization on the Text-Render-2M dataset, region-aware fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K, aesthetic-text reinforcement learning with preference optimization, and joint vision-language feedback refinement, supported by automated data pipelines.

Result: PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in text rendering accuracy, layout coherence, and visual appeal, nearing the quality of state-of-the-art commercial poster generation systems.

Conclusion: PosterCraft effectively improves aesthetic poster generation without complex architectural changes, leveraging large datasets and cascaded training stages, making it a robust solution for producing visually compelling poster designs.

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SbCA is a unified model for ultra-large scale image super-resolution, overcoming performance drops in traditional methods for very high upsampling factors by using stroke vector amplification and a cyclic refinement strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution methods degrade significantly and blur images when upsampling factors are beyond their training range. The motivation is to develop a model that can handle ultra-large upsampling while maintaining high quality and fidelity.

Method: SbCA leverages a stroke vector amplifier that represents images as vector strokes for effective magnification, combined with a detail completion module to restore lost details. Its cyclic strategy iteratively refines details using a single trained model across all scales, avoiding distribution drift issues.

Result: The method produces high-quality, artifact-free, and sharp super-resolved images even for ultra-large upsampling factors (e.g., 100x), significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: SbCA effectively addresses the challenges of ultra-large upsampling by decomposing images into stroke vectors and applying cyclic refinement, providing a robust, unified solution that produces superior super-resolution results across all scales with one model.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotPi is a physics-informed, object-centric model that improves dynamic reasoning by integrating physical knowledge and validating adaptability across diverse scenarios, including fluid-object interactions. It excels in prediction and Visual Question Answering tasks, demonstrating strong adaptability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object-centric dynamic simulation models fail to incorporate physical knowledge explicitly and lack validation across diverse real-world scenarios, especially those involving complex fluid and object interactions, limiting their reasoning and adaptability.

Method: SlotPi employs a slot-based approach combining a physics module based on Hamiltonian principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module to reason and forecast dynamics in object and fluid interaction scenarios.

Result: Experiments show SlotPi performs well on benchmark and fluid datasets in prediction and VQA tasks. A newly created real-world dataset testing object and fluid interactions further validates its strong adaptability and robust dynamic reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SlotPi's integration of physical principles with object-centric modeling significantly enhances dynamic reasoning and adaptability to complex scenarios, providing a foundation for more advanced world models in visual physical understanding.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional image-based navigation suffers from fixed-rate operation, motion blur, and latency, limiting real-time adaptive control in dynamic environments.

Method: The proposed framework combines asynchronous event camera data, additional range sensors, and application of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient reinforcement learning, enhanced by an initial imitation learning phase.

Result: Simulated experiments show the approach achieves robust navigation, pedestrian following, and obstacle avoidance, showcasing adaptability and efficiency.

Conclusion: Leveraging event cameras with reinforcement learning enables more responsive and reliable human-centered robot navigation compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event
cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time
human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional
image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion
blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated
environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and
obstacle avoidance. A demo video is available at the project website.

*Mario Barbara,Alaa Maalouf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Prompts-to-Summaries, a zero-shot, text-queryable video summarizer that uses pretrained video-language models and large language models without training data, outperforming unsupervised methods and matching supervised ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of video data demands flexible, user-controllable summarization tools that work without domain-specific training and can incorporate natural language user intent, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Method: The pipeline segments raw video into scenes, generates scene descriptions with a memory-efficient video-language model prompting, uses a large language model to score scene importance based on user queries, and propagates scores to fine-grained segments using temporal consistency and novelty metrics.

Result: On benchmarks SumMe and TVSum, the method surpasses all prior unsupervised data-hungry methods and performs competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization benchmark without any training data; also introduces a new dataset VidSum-Reason for evaluation.

Conclusion: Pretrained multimodal models combined with principled prompting and score propagation provide a strong basis for universal, user-guided, text-queryable video summarization without requiring training data.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

*Hang Zhang,Xiang Chen,Renjiu Hu,Rongguang Wang,Jinwei Zhang,Min Liu,Yaonan Wang,Gaolei Li,Xinxing Cheng,Jinming Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmoothProper is a neural module designed to improve learning-based deformable image registration in challenging cases like sparse-feature images with large smooth regions. It enforces smoothness and message passing within the network to overcome issues unsupervised methods face with aperture and large-displacement problems, achieving reduced registration error on retinal vessel images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based deformable image registration using neural networks struggles with images having sparse features and large smooth regions, such as retinal vessels, due to aperture and large-displacement challenges. Unsupervised methods fail as deformation fields predicted in a single pass remain unconstrained, and regularization depends only on network weights.

Method: SmoothProper integrates a duality-based optimization layer with interaction terms into the network's forward pass to propagate flow signals spatially, enforce smoothness, and maintain structural consistency. It is model-agnostic, plug-and-play, adds minimal parameter overhead, and removes the need for hyperparameter tuning of regularizers.

Result: When tested on a retinal vessel dataset with aperture and large-displacement challenges, SmoothProper reduced registration error to 1.88 pixels on large 2912x2912 images, demonstrating effective handling of these challenging cases by an unsupervised DIR method for the first time.

Conclusion: SmoothProper successfully addresses key challenges in unsupervised learning-based deformable image registration by enforcing smoothness and message passing within the network, improving accuracy without extra tuning and integrating easily into existing models.

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

*Hui Yang,Wei Sun,Jian Liu,Jin Zheng,Jian Xiao,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents HOMAE, an occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method using masked autoencoders, improving performance on occluded hand-object interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images struggle with severe occlusions and lack effective global structural perception and reasoning.

Method: HOMAE employs a target-focused masking strategy imposing structured occlusions to encourage context-aware feature learning. It predicts a signed distance field (SDF) using multi-scale decoder features and fuses the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from it for better geometric perception and occlusion handling.

Result: HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks DexYCB and HO3Dv2, demonstrating improved robustness against occlusions in hand-object pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances occlusion handling in hand-object pose estimation by combining masked autoencoder strategies with multi-scale feature fusion, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoDeepResearch is a new framework for long video understanding that uses a text-only large reasoning model combined with modular tools, improving performance significantly on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with LVU due to complexity and limited context windows, assumed to need extended models with strong visual and domain capabilities.

Method: The system uses a text-only reasoning model paired with multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers to selectively access video content and reason through LVU tasks.

Result: VideoDeepResearch outperforms existing MLLM baselines, achieving state-of-the-art improvements of 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU, LVBench, and LongVideoBench respectively.

Conclusion: Agentic systems combining reasoning models with modular multimodal tools can effectively address challenges in long video understanding, challenging prevailing assumptions about model requirements.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

### [179] [Post-Training Quantization for Video Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10840)
*Tianrui Zhu,Houyuan Chen,Ruihao Gong,Michele Magno,Haotong Qin,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents PTQ4VM, a novel post-training quantization framework for video matting models that preserves accuracy and temporal coherence on resource-constrained devices, achieving near full-precision performance even at ultra-low-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video matting models are computationally intensive and challenging to deploy on resource-limited devices. Existing post-training quantization methods face issues in maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence in video matting.

Method: PTQ4VM uses a two-stage PTQ strategy combining block-reconstruction optimization and global calibration, introduces a Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) to correct statistical distortions, and includes an Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component to leverage temporal and semantic frame information.

Result: The framework improves accuracy up to 20% over existing PTQ methods, achieves state-of-the-art performance across various bit-widths, and 4-bit quantization achieves performance close to full-precision with 8x FLOP savings.

Conclusion: PTQ4VM is the first systematic PTQ framework for video matting that effectively balances compression and accuracy, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices without significant performance loss.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRBench is a new benchmark with long videos and multi-step reasoning Q&A designed to evaluate large models' temporal and procedural reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for large models inadequately assess temporal reasoning and procedural validity in multi-step reasoning tasks within long narrative videos.

Method: VRBench consists of over 1,000 curated long videos, human-labeled multi-step Q&A pairs with detailed reasoning steps, and uses a human-AI collaborative framework to generate complex reasoning chains with timestamps. It includes a multi-phase evaluation pipeline with a novel LLM-guided scoring metric for reasoning quality beyond final answers.

Result: Extensive testing of 12 large language models and 16 vision-language models on VRBench revealed insights into their multi-step temporal reasoning capabilities and reasoning chain quality.

Conclusion: VRBench provides a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark advancing the assessment of multi-step temporal reasoning in AI models, combining video data, multi-step QA, reasoning chain evaluation, and novel scoring metrics.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CreatiPoster is a new AI framework that generates editable, multi-layer graphic designs from text or assets, surpassing current AI and commercial tools in quality and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality, editable graphic designs is time-consuming and requires skill, and existing AI tools cannot effectively produce professional, editable compositions incorporating user-provided assets.

Method: CreatiPoster uses an RGBA large multimodal protocol model to generate detailed JSON specifications for layered designs, followed by a conditional background model to synthesize coherent backgrounds; the system supports various editing and adaptation features.

Result: CreatiPoster outperforms open-source and commercial graphic design AI tools on automated benchmark metrics and provides a large corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs to support further research.

Conclusion: CreatiPoster advances AI-assisted graphic design by enabling accessible, editable, aesthetically pleasing multi-layer compositions, promoting democratization and diverse applications in the field.

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

### [182] [AIR: Zero-shot Generative Model Adaptation with Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10895)
*Guimeng Liu,Milad Abdollahzadeh,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) using text guidance without target domain samples, focusing on offset misalignment in CLIP embeddings and proposing a new method AIR to improve image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSGM methods assume perfect alignment between image and text offsets in CLIP embedding space, which leads to degraded image quality, motivating a study of offset misalignment to improve results.

Method: The paper empirically analyzes offset misalignment between text and image offsets in the CLIP embedding space across datasets, finding correlation with concept distance. Based on this, they propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR), a method that refines target domain adaptation to improve image quality.

Result: Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user studies with 26 experimental setups consistently show AIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZSGM compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: By focusing on offset misalignment and iteratively refining adaptation, AIR addresses a key limitation in ZSGM and significantly improves the quality of generated images in zero-shot domain adaptation.

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

*Jiancheng Huang,Gengwei Zhang,Zequn Jie,Siyu Jiao,Yinlong Qian,Ling Chen,Yunchao Wei,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M4V introduces an efficient Multi-Modal Mamba framework for text-to-video generation, leveraging a novel MM-DiM block and a reward learning strategy to reduce computational costs and enhance video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video generation is computationally expensive, especially using Transformers due to their quadratic complexity. Existing efficient models like Mamba are not directly applicable to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video tasks.

Method: M4V uses a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block to integrate multi-modal information and spatiotemporal features via token re-composition, reducing FLOPs by 45%. It also employs a reward learning strategy to improve visual quality during long-context autoregressive generation.

Result: M4V significantly lowers computational overhead compared to attention-based methods while producing high-quality videos on text-to-video benchmarks.

Conclusion: M4V provides an effective, resource-efficient approach to text-to-video generation, combining novel architectural improvements and learning strategies to advance video quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to train in-context image editing models directly from videos, bypassing the need for specialized pipelines and expert models. It introduces video annotation as interleaved multimodal sequences and trains a block-causal diffusion transformer on three proxy tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on new multi-turn image editing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing in-context image editing approaches rely heavily on task-specific pipelines and curated training data, which limits scalability and flexibility. The authors aim to explore if such a model can be learned directly from raw video data, simplifying the training process and expanding capabilities.

Method: The authors annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences comprising text and images. They design a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction. They also propose a new multi-turn image editing benchmark to evaluate performance.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed model learns strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Additionally, despite being trained solely on videos, the model demonstrates promising results in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing tasks.

Conclusion: Training in-context image editing models directly from videos is feasible and effective, enabling flexible and scalable learning. The introduced model and benchmark push the state of the art in multi-turn image editing and open new avenues for complex image editing applications.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectralAR is a novel autoregressive visual generation method using spectral tokens for efficient and causal image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive visual generation methods use spatial patches, which are parallel and conflict with the causal nature of autoregressive models.

Method: Transform images into ordered spectral tokens via Nested Spectral Tokenization, then autoregressively generate images in a coarse-to-fine manner over these spectral tokens.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, SpectralAR achieves strong performance with a 3.02 gFID score using only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

Conclusion: SpectralAR effectively enforces causality and improves token efficiency in autoregressive visual generation by leveraging spectral representations.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces knowledge image generation as a new AI task and presents the MMMG benchmark with 4,456 expert-validated knowledge image-prompt pairs to evaluate reasoning capability in image generation. It proposes a unified Knowledge Graph representation and the MMMG-Score metric to assess factual fidelity and visual clarity. Evaluations reveal current models, including GPT-4o, perform poorly, highlighting challenges in the task. An open baseline model, FLUX-Reason, is released to encourage progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge images are fundamental to human learning and communication, but generating them demands complex multimodal reasoning integrating world knowledge and pixel-level image creation. Existing image generation models lack evaluation benchmarks and metrics targeting this specific capability.

Method: The authors created the MMMG benchmark covering multiple disciplines, educational levels, and image formats. They use unified Knowledge Graphs to represent target images and propose MMMG-Score combining graph-edit distance (for factual accuracy) and visual assessment. They evaluated 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image models and developed FLUX-Reason, a new baseline combining a reasoning large language model with diffusion models trained on curated data.

Result: Results show significant reasoning deficits in current models, with poor entity accuracy, weak relational understanding, and cluttered visuals. For instance, GPT-4o scored only 50.20 on the MMMG-Score, demonstrating the difficulty of the task. The new baseline FLUX-Reason achieved a score of 34.45, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a challenging benchmark and metric for knowledge image generation, revealing major limitations in existing models' reasoning abilities. By releasing an effective open baseline, it aims to facilitate further research and advances in generating accurate, clear knowledge images.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

*Qizhe Zhang,Mengzhen Liu,Lichen Li,Ming Lu,Yuan Zhang,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CDPruner is a novel visual token pruning method for multimodal large language models that maximizes conditional diversity using determinantal point process, improving efficiency and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual token pruning methods either retain redundant tokens or ignore instruction relevance, leading to high inference costs and suboptimal performance in MLLMs.

Method: CDPruner defines conditional similarity between visual tokens based on instructions, formulates pruning as a determinantal point process to maximize conditional diversity, and is training-free and model-agnostic.

Result: CDPruner achieves state-of-the-art results on various vision-language benchmarks, significantly reduces FLOPs and latency, and maintains 94% of original accuracy with a 95% reduction in computational cost.

Conclusion: Maximizing conditional diversity of visual tokens via DPP enables efficient and instruction-relevant token selection that preserves strong performance in MLLMs.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: GenWorld is a large-scale, realistic dataset for AI-generated video detection, addressing the need for trustworthy detectors by focusing on high-quality, real-world-like videos. The paper also introduces SpannDetector, a method leveraging multi-view consistency to detect such videos effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing realism of AI-generated videos threatens information credibility, but progress is constrained by the lack of quality real-world datasets for training trustworthy detectors.

Method: The authors created GenWorld, a dataset simulating real-world scenarios using multiple state-of-the-art video generators from diverse prompt modalities. They analyzed existing detectors' failures on high-quality generated videos and proposed SpannDetector, which uses multi-view consistency to improve detection based on physical plausibility cues.

Result: Experiments demonstrate SpannDetector outperforms existing methods in detecting high-quality AI-generated videos, especially those created by advanced world models like Cosmos, proving the effectiveness of leveraging multi-view consistency.

Conclusion: GenWorld and SpannDetector contribute significantly to AI-generated video detection, providing a realistic dataset and a novel, explainable detection approach that advances the field by focusing on physical plausibility and multi-view analysis.

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

### [189] [QuadricFormer: Scene as Superquadrics for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10977)
*Sicheng Zuo,Wenzhao Zheng,Xiaoyong Han,Longchao Yang,Yong Pan,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction model improving efficiency and accuracy by representing driving scenes with diverse geometric primitives instead of ellipsoidal Gaussians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voxel-based and Gaussian-based methods for 3D occupancy prediction are inefficient due to scene sparsity and limited shape representation, respectively, hindering accurate modeling of diverse real-world object geometries.

Method: Proposes using superquadrics as flexible scene primitives modeled probabilistically as occupancy distributions with a geometry prior, coupled with a pruning-and-splitting module to focus primitives in occupied spaces, forming the QuadricFormer framework.

Result: Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show QuadricFormer surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance and efficiency for 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving scenes.

Conclusion: Utilizing superquadric primitives with probabilistic modeling and an efficiency-focused module enables more accurate and efficient 3D occupancy prediction, advancing autonomous driving perception capabilities.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

### [190] [Fine-Grained Perturbation Guidance via Attention Head Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10978)
*Donghoon Ahn,Jiwon Kang,Sanghyun Lee,Minjae Kim,Jaewon Min,Wooseok Jang,Saungwu Lee,Sayak Paul,Susung Hong,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HeadHunter, a framework for fine-grained attention head perturbation in Diffusion Transformer models, enabling improved control over image generation quality and style. It addresses limitations of existing layer-level perturbations by identifying specific attention heads tied to visual attributes and uses SoftPAG to tune perturbation strength, validated on large-scale models like Stable Diffusion 3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention perturbation methods in diffusion models lack principled approaches to determine where to apply perturbations, especially within Diffusion Transformer architectures where quality-relevant computations are spread across layers. This results in oversmoothing and limited control over visual attributes.

Method: The authors investigate attention perturbations at different granularities down to individual heads, discovering that heads correspond to distinct visual concepts. They propose HeadHunter, an iterative framework to select attention heads aligned with user goals, and SoftPAG, a technique to softly modulate attention maps toward the identity matrix for continuous perturbation strength tuning.

Result: The method effectively reduces oversmoothing seen in prior layer-level perturbations and allows for targeted manipulation of visual styles through compositional head selection. Experiments on DiT-based text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion 3 show superior quality enhancement and style-specific guidance compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: HeadHunter provides the first detailed head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, revealing interpretable head specializations and enabling practical, effective perturbation strategies for improved generation quality and style control.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

### [191] [InstaInpaint: Instant 3D-Scene Inpainting with Masked Large Reconstruction Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10980)
*Junqi You,Chieh Hubert Lin,Weijie Lyu,Zhengbo Zhang,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaInpaint is a fast 3D scene inpainting framework that enables real-time editing by using a reference-based feed-forward model, achieving a 1000x speed-up over previous methods without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene inpainting methods are too slow and computationally heavy for real-time interactive applications in virtual and augmented reality.

Method: The paper proposes InstaInpaint, a feed-forward framework leveraging a 2D inpainting proposal, with a self-supervised masked-finetuning strategy to train a custom large reconstruction model on large-scale data.

Result: InstaInpaint completes 3D scene inpainting within 0.4 seconds, showing state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and strong generalization to tasks like object insertion and multi-region inpainting.

Conclusion: InstaInpaint provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time 3D scene editing, significantly advancing the usability of 3D inpainting for immersive applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

### [192] [SceneCompleter: Dense 3D Scene Completion for Generative Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10981)
*Weiliang Chen,Jiayi Bi,Yuanhui Huang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents SceneCompleter, a framework for 3D-consistent novel view synthesis using a dual-stream diffusion model and a scene embedder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative novel view synthesis methods rely on 2D completion followed by 3D reconstruction, leading to overly smooth and distorted geometries due to limited 3D structural inference from RGB data alone.

Method: SceneCompleter introduces a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model for joint RGBD novel view synthesis and a scene embedder for holistic scene understanding from a reference image, enabling dense 3D scene completion.

Result: The method achieves superior visual coherence and 3D-consistent generative scene completion across various datasets by effectively fusing structural and textural information.

Conclusion: SceneCompleter advances generative novel view synthesis by addressing 3D consistency issues, producing more plausible and coherent scene completions compared to conventional 2D-first approaches.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.
