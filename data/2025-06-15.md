### [2] [LoRA-Edit: Controllable First-Frame-Guided Video Editing via Mask-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10082)
*Chenjian Gao,Lihe Ding,Xin Cai,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a mask-based LoRA tuning method to adapt pretrained Image-to-Video models for flexible and efficient video editing, allowing controllable propagation of edits while preserving backgrounds, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video editing methods rely heavily on large-scale pretraining and lack flexibility, especially for controlling edits beyond the first frame, limiting their adaptability for specific edits.

Method: The authors propose a mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts pretrained I2V models by using spatial masks to modulate attention region-wise, incorporating additional reference images as visual anchors to guide editing with control over appearance and motion.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that their method outperforms state-of-the-art video editing techniques, offering superior video editing quality and flexibility without altering the model architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed mask-based LoRA tuning approach enables efficient, flexible, and controllable video editing by leveraging pretrained models and additional visual references, overcoming limitations of prior methods while preserving background and spatial motion structure.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [3] [DeepTraverse: A Depth-First Search Inspired Network for Algorithmic Visual Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10084)
*Bin Guo,John H. L. Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepTraverse is a vision architecture inspired by search algorithms that builds features through adaptive, iterative refinement. It uses recursive exploration and adaptive calibration modules to improve feature construction, outperforming conventional models on image classification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional vision backbones apply mostly uniform feature extraction processes, lacking explicit adaptive and iterative refinement pathways. Integrating algorithmic search principles may enable more structured, interpretable, and reasoning-like feature construction.

Method: DeepTraverse introduces recursive exploration modules that deepen feature analysis with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that adjust feature salience based on global context. Together, these components enable systematic and adaptive feature refinement.

Result: DeepTraverse achieves highly competitive classification accuracy and strong feature discrimination across diverse image classification benchmarks, often surpassing conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts.

Conclusion: Incorporating algorithmic search-inspired priors into vision backbones is a principled and effective approach to developing more efficient, structured, and performant feature representations.

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

### [4] [Test-Time Adaptation for Generalizable Task Progress Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10085)
*Christos Ziakas,Alessandra Russo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a test-time adaptation method for progress estimation models, which adapts online to new visual and temporal contexts by optimizing a self-supervised objective using gradient-based meta-learning. It generalizes well to out-of-distribution tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing progress estimation models struggle to adapt to new environments and tasks, especially when there is distribution shift in visual and temporal data. There is a need for models that can adapt online during testing to improve robustness and semantic understanding.

Method: The method involves training a model with a gradient-based meta-learning strategy on expert visual trajectories and corresponding natural language task descriptions. At test-time, the model adapts online using a learned self-supervised objective, improving reliance on semantic content rather than just temporal order.

Result: The proposed approach generalizes from a single training environment to diverse, out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and embodiments. It achieves better performance than the current state-of-the-art in-context learning methods that use autoregressive vision-language models.

Conclusion: Test-time adaptation via gradient-based meta-learning and self-supervised objectives enables progress estimation models to effectively adapt to new contexts, improving generalization and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a test-time adaptation method that enables a progress estimation
model to adapt online to the visual and temporal context of test trajectories
by optimizing a learned self-supervised objective. To this end, we introduce a
gradient-based meta-learning strategy to train the model on expert visual
trajectories and their natural language task descriptions, such that test-time
adaptation improves progress estimation relying on semantic content over
temporal order. Our test-time adaptation method generalizes from a single
training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and
embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art in-context learning approach
using autoregressive vision-language models.

### [5] [EfficientVLA: Training-Free Acceleration and Compression for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10100)
*Yantai Yang,Yuhao Wang,Zichen Wen,Luo Zhongwei,Chang Zou,Zhipeng Zhang,Chuan Wen,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientVLA is a structured, training-free framework that accelerates inference in Vision-Language-Action models by removing redundancies across the entire pipeline, significantly improving speed and efficiency with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models, especially diffusion-based ones, face high computational and memory demands due to redundancies, limiting their practical use. Existing acceleration techniques address only isolated issues and fail to tackle the diverse bottlenecks holistically.

Method: EfficientVLA integrates three strategies: pruning redundant layers in the language module based on inter-layer redundancy analysis; optimizing the visual pathway by selecting a compact, informative set of visual tokens; and reducing temporal computational redundancy in the diffusion-based action head by caching and reusing intermediate features.

Result: When applied to the CogACT model, EfficientVLA achieves a 1.93X speedup in inference and cuts FLOPs to 28.9% of the original, with only a 0.6% drop in success rate on the SIMPLER benchmark.

Conclusion: EfficientVLA effectively and comprehensively reduces computational and memory bottlenecks in VLA models without retraining, enabling more practical deployment with substantial efficiency gains and negligible performance degradation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

### [6] [A Manually Annotated Image-Caption Dataset for Detecting Children in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10117)
*Klim Kireev,Ana-Maria Creţu,Raphael Meier,Sarah Adel Bargal,Elissa Redmiles,Carmela Troncoso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the ICCWD dataset to benchmark detection of digital content depicting minors using image-caption pairs, demonstrating the challenges with current detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of datasets and benchmarks for detecting depictions of minors in multi-modal (image-caption) content, despite the importance of such detection for law and platform regulation.

Method: The authors created ICCWD, a dataset containing 10,000 manually labeled image-caption pairs depicting children in various contexts, and benchmarked three detection methods including a commercial age estimation system.

Result: The benchmark results show that child detection is difficult; the best method achieved only a 75.3% true positive rate, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: The release of ICCWD aims to support the development of more effective minor detection tools across diverse scenarios in digital content.

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

*Natanael Lucena,Fábio S. da Silva,Ricardo Rios*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares CNNs and Vision Transformers for psoriasis image classification, finding ViTs, especially DaViT-B, to perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine which model architecture, CNNs or ViTs, better classifies images of psoriasis and similar diseases.

Method: Pre-trained CNN and ViT models on ImageNet were fine-tuned on a psoriasis lesion dataset, and their predictive performance was evaluated.

Result: Both models achieved high accuracy, but ViTs, particularly the Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base, showed superior performance and efficiency, achieving an f1-score of 96.4%.

Conclusion: ViTs, especially DaViT-B, are superior and efficient for automated psoriasis image classification, highlighting their potential in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in the task of multi-classifying
images containing lesions of psoriasis and diseases similar to it. Models
pre-trained on ImageNet were adapted to a specific data set. Both achieved high
predictive metrics, but the ViTs stood out for their superior performance with
smaller models. Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base (DaViT-B) obtained the
best results, with an f1-score of 96.4%, and is recommended as the most
efficient architecture for automated psoriasis detection. This article
reinforces the potential of ViTs for medical image classification tasks.

### [8] [ViCrit: A Verifiable Reinforcement Learning Proxy Task for Visual Perception in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10128)
*Xiyao Wang,Zhengyuan Yang,Chao Feng,Yongyuan Liang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiaoyu Liu,Ziyi Zang,Ming Li,Chung-Ching Lin,Kevin Lin,Linjie Li,Furong Huang,Lijuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents ViCrit, a novel reinforcement learning proxy task that trains vision-language models to detect subtle visual hallucinations in image captions, significantly improving visual perception across benchmarks and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of training vision-language models on tasks that are both challenging and unambiguously verifiable, facilitating improved visual perception beyond memorization.

Method: Inject subtle visual description errors into image captions and task the model to localize the corrupted span, using a binary exact-match reward for reinforcement learning.

Result: Models trained with ViCrit showed substantial improvements across various vision-language benchmarks, including abstract image reasoning and visual math, demonstrating better perception capabilities.

Conclusion: Fine-grained hallucination criticism via the ViCrit task provides an effective, generalizable training objective to enhance the visual perception abilities of vision-language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

### [9] [RoCA: Robust Cross-Domain End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10145)
*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hsin-Pai Cheng,Litian Liu,Shweta Mahajan,Apratim Bhattacharyya,Yunxiao Shi,Risheek Garrepalli,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoCA is a new framework for robust cross-domain end-to-end autonomous driving, improving generalization and adaptation across different domains without extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E2E autonomous driving faces challenges in cross-domain deployment with costly retraining and uncertain performance when using Large Language Models.

Method: RoCA models joint probabilistic distribution of tokens encoding vehicle info using Gaussian processes to learn basis tokens and infer trajectories, enhancing cross-domain robustness.

Result: RoCA combined with base E2E models improves generalizability and outperforms direct finetuning in adaptation to new domains, demonstrated across multiple scenarios.

Conclusion: RoCA is effective for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving, achieving strong generalization and adaptation without extra inference overhead.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

### [10] [SPARKE: Scalable Prompt-Aware Diversity Guidance in Diffusion Models via RKE Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10173)
*Mohammad Jalali,Haoyu Lei,Amin Gohari,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARKE is a new method that improves prompt-aware diversity in text-to-image diffusion models using efficient entropy-based guidance, enabling scalable and diverse image generations without high computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt-guided diffusion models struggle to generate diverse samples across semantically similar prompts, and existing entropy-based diversity metrics are computationally expensive for large-scale generation.

Method: The paper proposes SPARKE, which uses conditional entropy for diversity guidance tailored to similar prompts, and introduces Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance to reduce computational complexity from cubic to linear in entropy calculations.

Result: SPARKE enables diversity-guided sampling over thousands of generation rounds efficiently and improves prompt-aware diversity in text-to-image diffusion models while keeping computational costs low.

Conclusion: SPARKE effectively enhances diversity in prompt-guided diffusion models in a scalable way, making entropy-based diversity control practical for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

### [11] [Retrieval of Surface Solar Radiation through Implicit Albedo Recovery from Temporal Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10174)
*Yael Frischholz,Devis Tuia,Michael Lehning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an attention-based Vision Transformer model for accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery, particularly improving performance in mountainous regions with dynamic snow cover by learning clear-sky surface reflectance without relying on hand-crafted features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSR retrieval methods rely on monthly statistical background reflectance, which fails in mountainous regions with variable snow cover and surfaces, impacting cloud detection and atmospheric attenuation estimation.

Method: They developed a Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer emulator trained on HelioMont SSR estimates using multi-spectral SEVIRI satellite data, combined with static topographic features and solar geometry, to learn clear-sky surface reflectance from raw image sequences without explicit albedo or cloud masks.

Result: The model achieved performance comparable to albedo-informed models when given sufficient temporal context and showed enhanced generalization and effectiveness in mountainous and complex terrain areas by internally capturing latent surface reflectance dynamics.

Conclusion: The attention-based transformer approach provides a robust and generalized SSR retrieval method that better handles complex and dynamic surface conditions, notably in mountainous regions, without requiring handcrafted input features; the approach and data are publicly accessible.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at
https://github.com/frischwood/HeMu-dev.git

### [12] [Attention, Please! Revisiting Attentive Probing for Masked Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10178)
*Bill Psomas,Dionysis Christopoulos,Eirini Baltzi,Ioannis Kakogeorgiou,Tilemachos Aravanis,Nikos Komodakis,Konstantinos Karantzalos,Yannis Avrithis,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention method for evaluating self-supervised learning models, especially those trained with Masked Image Modeling, improving accuracy and computational efficiency over existing linear and attentive probing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard linear probing inadequately captures the potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling due to distributed patch tokens; attentive probing methods exist but suffer from high parameter count and inefficiency, motivating a more efficient approach.

Method: Systematic study of existing attentive probing methods, followed by introducing efficient probing (EP), which uses multi-query cross-attention to reduce redundant projections, lowers trainable parameters, and speeds up computation by up to 10 times compared to typical multi-head attention.

Result: EP outperforms linear probing and prior attentive probing methods on seven benchmarks, generalizes well to different pre-training paradigms, yields interpretable attention maps, and excels in low-shot and layer-wise experiments with significantly better efficiency.

Conclusion: Efficient probing is a simple, effective, and computationally efficient alternative for evaluating SSL models, especially MIM-trained ones, offering improved accuracy and scalability without the drawbacks of prior methods.

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

### [13] [Improving Personalized Search with Regularized Low-Rank Parameter Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10182)
*Fiona Ryan,Josef Sivic,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Judy Hoffman,James M. Rehg,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to adapt vision-language models for personalized image retrieval by fine-tuning few parameters in the language encoder, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recognize new personal concepts from few examples while integrating personal and general knowledge in vision-language retrieval.

Method: Regularized low-rank adaptation of parameters in the language encoder's final layer, parameter addition for multiple concepts, and a new metric for preserving general knowledge in fine-tuned models.

Result: Achieved 4%-22% improvement over prior methods on benchmarks DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi for personalized image retrieval.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptation method effectively learns personal concepts with few examples while maintaining general knowledge, enabling superior personalized vision-language retrieval performance.

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

### [14] [ScoreMix: Improving Face Recognition via Score Composition in Diffusion Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10226)
*Parsa Rahimi,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScoreMix is a new data augmentation method that mixes diffusion model scores from different class conditions to generate synthetic samples, improving discriminator performance especially with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance discriminator performance in scenarios with limited labeled data by leveraging diffusion models for data augmentation.

Method: Convexly mixing scores from different class-conditioned diffusion trajectories to generate challenging synthetic samples.

Result: Significant improvement in discriminator capabilities across benchmarks, especially when mixing classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space; minimal correlation found between generator's and discriminator's spaces.

Conclusion: ScoreMix provides practical performance gains without extensive parameter tuning, aiding discriminative model training and reducing the need for large datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

*Hamid Kamangir,Mona Hajiesmaeeli,Mason Earles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark dataset and a multi-modal deep learning model for forecasting crop yields across California counties, achieving strong predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and timely crop yield forecasting is challenging due to the complex interaction of environmental, climatic, and soil factors despite extensive historical data.

Method: The study developed a comprehensive dataset integrating satellite imagery, climate records, evapotranspiration, and soil properties, and designed a multi-modal deep learning model using stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to capture spatial-temporal dynamics and static inputs.

Result: The model achieved an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops on an unseen test dataset, demonstrating strong predictive performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark dataset and modeling framework provide a valuable foundation for improving agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation, and precision farming, with resources made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at
our GitHub repository.

### [16] [DySS: Dynamic Queries and State-Space Learning for Efficient 3D Object Detection from Multi-Camera Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10242)
*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DySS is a novel 3D object detection method for autonomous driving that uses state-space learning and dynamic queries to enhance efficiency and performance in Bird's Eye View perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for camera-based 3D object detection using BEV features are either costly due to dense feature construction or inefficient due to the need for many queries, especially when processing multiple video frames.

Method: DySS employs a state-space model to sequentially process sampled features over time, enhanced by auxiliary tasks like future prediction and masked reconstruction. It dynamically updates detection queries via merge, remove, and split operations to maintain a streamlined set of queries.

Result: DySS achieves superior detection accuracy with 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP on the nuScenes test split and runs in real-time at 33 FPS on the validation split, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: By integrating state-space learning and dynamic query management, DySS offers an efficient and effective approach for camera-based 3D object detection, balancing performance and inference speed for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

### [17] [HalLoc: Token-level Localization of Hallucinations for Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10286)
*Eunkyu Park,Minyeong Kim,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HalLoc is a large-scale dataset and baseline model for probabilistic hallucination detection in vision-language tasks, enabling efficient and graded confidence detection to improve model reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models suffer from hallucinations that undermine accuracy and trustworthiness. Existing detection methods are computationally heavy and yield binary outcomes that don't reflect real-world uncertainties.

Method: The authors create HalLoc, a 150K token-level annotated dataset covering multiple tasks with hallucination types labeled. They also develop a low-overhead hallucination detection model that can run concurrently with generation and integrate into existing models.

Result: The baseline model trained on HalLoc efficiently detects hallucinations with graded confidence, supporting more nuanced detection and user interaction while maintaining low latency and resource usage.

Conclusion: HalLoc enables the development of practical, reliable hallucination detection modules that can be easily plugged into vision-language models, enhancing their trustworthiness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

*Hamzeh Asgharnezhad,Pegah Tabarisaadi,Abbas Khosravi,Roohallah Alizadehsani,U. Rajendra Acharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates deep learning models for skin cancer classification on the HAM10000 dataset, utilizing transfer learning and uncertainty quantification to improve performance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of data scarcity and lack of uncertainty awareness in deep learning models for skin cancer diagnosis, aiming for more accurate and trustworthy predictions.

Method: Benchmark pre-trained feature extractors combined with traditional classifiers, then incorporate uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, EMCD) to evaluate both accuracy and reliability using uncertainty-aware metrics.

Result: CLIP-based vision transformers with SVM achieved highest accuracy; ensemble methods balanced accuracy and uncertainty well; EMCD was most sensitive to uncertain predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating uncertainty quantification into deep learning skin cancer diagnosis models enhances both predictive performance and reliability, supporting clinical trust and application.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

*Sadia Kamal,Tim Oates,Joy Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly supervised multimodal framework for generating SOAP notes from limited clinical inputs to reduce clinician workload and reliance on large annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual generation of detailed SOAP notes in clinical settings is labor-intensive, contributing to clinician burnout and high healthcare expenditures.

Method: A weakly supervised multimodal approach that uses lesion images and sparse clinical text to produce clinically structured SOAP notes, reducing dependence on manual annotation.

Result: The method achieves performance comparable to advanced AI models like GPT-4o and Claude, evaluated with new clinical quality metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is scalable, clinically grounded, and effectively reduces clinician documentation burden while maintaining high clinical relevance in generated notes.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

*Fei Zhao,Da Pan,Zelu Qi,Ping Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper builds a new dataset of user-generated omnidirectional audio-visual content and proposes a baseline model for assessing their audio-visual quality, showing strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of the Metaverse has raised interest in omnidirectional videos, especially user-generated content, but audio-visual quality assessment for such content is underexplored.

Method: The authors collected 300 omnidirectional videos from 5 users using two camera types, covering 10 scenes, conducted subjective AV quality scoring, and developed a baseline model with video and audio feature extraction and fusion modules.

Result: The baseline AVQA model showed optimal performance on the newly created dataset, validating its effectiveness for assessing user-generated omnidirectional A/V content quality.

Conclusion: This work provides a valuable dataset and a strong AVQA baseline for advancing research on quality assessment of user-generated omnidirectional audio-visual content in the Metaverse context.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

### [21] [Using Vision Language Models to Detect Students' Academic Emotion through Facial Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10334)
*Deliang Wang,Chao Yang,Gaowei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to analyze students' academic emotions from facial expressions captured in online learning. Two VLMs were tested on zero-shot emotion recognition, showing moderate accuracy, especially for happy and confused emotions but struggling with distracted ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised machine learning methods for analyzing students' academic emotions require extensive data annotation and retraining, limiting their generalizability. The study aims to leverage VLMs to provide more adaptable and less resource-intensive emotion recognition.

Method: The authors applied zero-shot prompting of two VLMs, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000 facial images categorized by academic emotions like confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired.

Result: Both models showed moderate performance, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B. Both models were good at detecting happy expressions but poor at distracted behaviors. Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct also performed well in recognizing confused expressions, indicating its practical value.

Conclusion: VLMs can moderately recognize academic emotions from facial expressions without fine-tuning, highlighting their potential for scalable, zero-shot emotion analysis in educational settings, particularly in detecting confusion to improve learning experiences.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

### [22] [PointGS: Point Attention-Aware Sparse View Synthesis with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10335)
*Lintao Xiang,Hongpei Zheng,Yating Huang,Qijun Yang,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework that improves 3D Gaussian splatting for rendering high-quality 3D scenes from limited views, outperforming NeRF and prior 3DGS methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian splatting methods require many calibrated views and tend to overfit when input views are sparse, degrading rendering quality.

Method: They introduce a Point-wise Feature-Aware Gaussian Splatting framework using stereo models for camera pose estimation and dense point cloud reconstruction, multiscale 2D feature aggregation, and a self-attention-based point interaction network, decoded by lightweight MLPs.

Result: The proposed method achieves significantly better performance than NeRF and competitive results compared to state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches, especially in few-shot (sparse view) settings.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables real-time, high-quality rendering from sparse views, addressing overfitting issues and advancing 3D scene reconstruction and rendering techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

### [23] [GeoCAD: Local Geometry-Controllable CAD Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10337)
*Zhanwei Zhang,Kaiyuan Liu,Junjie Liu,Wenxiao Wang,Binbin Lin,Liang Xie,Chen Shen,Deng Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoCAD is a novel CAD generation method that enables user-controllable local geometric modifications by generating and using detailed geometric instructions for local parts, improving design efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD generation methods struggle to modify local parts of models based on user-specific geometric instructions, either failing to follow textual inputs or focusing poorly on local regions.

Method: GeoCAD introduces a complementary captioning strategy using vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning to annotate local parts with geometric instructions. During training, local parts are masked and predicted by large language models guided by geometric instructions. Users can specify local modifications during inference.

Result: GeoCAD demonstrated improved generation quality, CAD validity, and text-to-CAD consistency through extensive experiments, handling a large annotated dataset of local parts (~221k).

Conclusion: GeoCAD effectively enables local geometry-controllable CAD generation that adheres to user-defined geometric instructions, enhancing flexibility and usability in CAD design.

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

*Jun Yin,Jing Zhong,Peilin Li,Pengyu Zeng,Miao Zhang,Ran Luo,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a vision-language model framework that quantitatively analyzes urban streetscape styles across cities and periods, demonstrated with a new dataset capturing Beijing and Shenzhen's architectural evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional subjective urban cultural studies by providing an objective, standardized, and scalable method to analyze urban streetscape style differences.

Method: Developed UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban streetscape images, and UrbanSense, a vision-language-model-based framework that generates and compares quantitative urban style representations.

Result: Over 80% of generated style descriptions were statistically significant (t-test p<0.05); subjective evaluations showed high agreement (Phi scores: 0.912 for city difference, 0.833 for period difference), indicating reliable capture of subtle stylistic differences.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a data-driven, objective tool to quantify and interpret urban style evolution, facilitating scientifically grounded urban design and cultural analysis.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

### [25] [RealKeyMorph: Keypoints in Real-world Coordinates for Resolution-agnostic Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10344)
*Mina C. Moghadam,Alan Q. Wang,Omer Taub,Martin R. Prince,Mert R. Sabuncu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RealKeyMorph (RKM) is a resolution-agnostic medical image registration method that avoids resampling artifacts by operating directly in real-world scanner coordinates, improving registration across images with differing spatial resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning-based registration methods resample images to a fixed resolution, which can introduce interpolation artifacts and degrade accuracy, especially when dealing with images differing in spatial resolution due to acquisition parameters.

Method: RKM extends KeyMorph by outputting keypoints in real-world coordinates using the scanner affine matrix to map voxel to real-world space, allowing resolution-agnostic keypoint extraction and registration without resampling. The method trains a network to learn corresponding keypoints and uses closed-form matching for alignment.

Result: RKM demonstrated effective registration on orthogonal 2D abdominal MRI stacks and 3D brain volumes with varying resolutions, showing improved handling of images with different spatial resolutions without resampling artifacts.

Conclusion: By integrating real-world coordinate information into training and registration, RKM overcomes the limitations of fixed-resolution resampling, enabling more accurate and artifact-free medical image registration across varying spatial resolutions.

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

*Runqi Ouyang,Haoyun Li,Zhenyuan Zhang,Xiaofeng Wang,Zheng Zhu,Guan Huang,Xingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-R1 is a new framework that improves text-to-motion generation by integrating Chain-of-Thought mechanisms to better understand complex instructions, resulting in more controllable, consistent, and diverse motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-motion models struggle with capturing deep linguistic structure and logical reasoning, leading to limitations in controllability, consistency, and diversity of generated motions.

Method: Motion-R1 uses a Chain-of-Thought approach to break down textual instructions into logical action paths and employs Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to jointly optimize reasoning and motion synthesis.

Result: Motion-R1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, especially excelling at nuanced semantic understanding and maintaining long-term temporal coherence in generated motions.

Conclusion: Integrating structured reasoning and reinforcement learning in text-to-motion generation significantly enhances performance, controllability, and semantic alignment, offering a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper proposes FSATFusion, an end-to-end network using a frequency-spatial attention Transformer to improve infrared and visible image fusion, showing superior performance and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing convolutional neural network-based methods for infrared and visible image fusion suffer from limited ability to capture global context, causing information loss and restricting fusion quality.

Method: FSATFusion introduces a frequency-spatial attention Transformer module comprising a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) for extracting significant features and an improved Transformer module (ITM) to better capture global context.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments show FSATFusion surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fusion quality and efficiency; it also generalizes well to other tasks and improves object detection performance.

Conclusion: FSATFusion effectively overcomes limitations of convolution-based methods, providing superior fusion results and strong applicability in downstream visual tasks, confirmed by extensive experiments.

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

### [29] [Revisiting Transformers with Insights from Image Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10371)
*Laziz U. Abdullaev,Maksim Tkachenko,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a unifying image processing framework to interpret the self-attention mechanism and its architectural components in Transformers, introducing modifications that improve both interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the widespread success of self-attention in Transformers, its functioning remains largely heuristic and not well understood theoretically. Existing frameworks lack mechanistic interpretation of key components like positional encoding and residual connections.

Method: The authors propose a unifying image processing framework that explains self-attention and associated components in Transformers. They introduce two novel architectural modifications inspired by image processing within the Transformer architecture.

Result: The proposed modifications not only enhance interpretability but also empirically improve accuracy, robustness against contamination and adversaries, and long-sequence understanding across both language and vision tasks.

Conclusion: A mechanistic image processing perspective on self-attention and architectural components advances theoretical understanding and yields practical benefits in performance and robustness for Transformer models.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

*Jerry Yan,Chinmay Talegaonkar,Nicholas Antipa,Eric Terrill,Sophia Merrifield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseIDON is a computer vision pipeline that estimates the burial depth and pose of objects on the seafloor from ROV video, achieving about 10 cm accuracy at a historic dumpsite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accurate burial depth estimation of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor, which is essential for assessing ecological risks, pollutant transport, and mitigation strategies, despite challenges like occlusion and poor visibility.

Method: Combines deep foundation model features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate object pose and seafloor orientation, inferring burial depth by aligning CAD models to imagery and fitting a planar seafloor model.

Result: Validated on 54 objects including barrels and munitions, achieving a mean burial depth error of ~10 cm and identifying spatial burial patterns related to sediment transport.

Conclusion: The method enables scalable, non-invasive seafloor burial mapping that supports environmental assessment and hazard mitigation at contaminated marine sites.

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

### [31] [DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Transformer and Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390)
*Shicheng Yin,Kaixuan Yin,Yang Liu,Weixing Chen,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DART, a differentiable tokenizer that adaptively partitions images into variable-sized patches for vision transformers, improving accuracy and efficiency by focusing on information-rich regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-size patches in non-convolutional vision models lead to unnecessary encoding of background and miss critical local details, especially in images with sparse informative objects.

Method: DART uses learnable region scores and piecewise differentiable quantile operations to dynamically assign denser tokens to important areas, adapting patch size content-dependently.

Result: DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT ImageNet-1K with only ~1M extra parameters, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction and consistently enhances performance on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba with minimal or reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: DART provides an efficient and effective way to adaptively tokenize images for vision transformers, capturing fine-grained details more efficiently than uniform token density increase methods.

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

*Yuanyi Song,Pumeng Lyu,Ben Fei,Fenghua Ling,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReconMOST is a diffusion model framework for reconstructing multi-layer ocean temperature globally, overcoming sparse data and cloud occlusion issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ocean reconstruction methods suffer from data sparsity, algorithmic complexity, and high computational costs. Machine learning approaches have been limited to surface and local areas, struggling with cloud occlusion and incomplete data.

Method: ReconMOST pre-trains an unconditional diffusion model on extensive historical numerical simulation data to learn physically consistent ocean temperature patterns. During generation, sparse in-situ observations guide the reverse diffusion process, enabling accurate reconstruction even in areas without direct observations by leveraging learned spatial consistency.

Result: The method handles over 92.5% missing data globally with high accuracy and resolution, showing strong generalization. Experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 datasets achieve low mean squared errors (0.049 on guidance points, 0.680 on reconstruction), proving effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: ReconMOST successfully extends machine learning ocean temperature reconstruction to global multi-layer scales, providing a physically consistent, accurate, and efficient tool for ocean dynamic studies and marine meteorology research.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/norsheep/ReconMOST.

TL;DR: Pisces is a new multimodal foundation model with separate visual encoders for image understanding and generation, trained with tailored methods and data, achieving strong performance across more than 20 benchmarks in both tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified multimodal models often underperform specialized models due to differences in visual features and training processes for image understanding versus generation.

Method: Pisces uses a decoupled visual encoding architecture and customized training techniques, along with careful data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, to address the challenges in unified multimodal modeling.

Result: Pisces demonstrates competitive and robust performance on over 20 public image understanding benchmarks and the GenEval image generation benchmark.

Conclusion: Separating visual encoders and specialized training enhances unified multimodal model performance, revealing synergistic effects between image understanding and generation, advancing unified multimodal modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

*Guoyi Zhang,Guangsheng Xu,Siyang Chen,Han Wang,Xiaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRRNet is a new end-to-end deep learning framework for infrared small target detection that models low-rank background structures to improve accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection is challenging due to low signal-to-clutter ratios, diverse target shapes, and lack of distinctive features, causing unstable performance in current deep learning methods.

Method: LRRNet uses a compression-reconstruction-subtraction paradigm to directly learn low-rank background representations in the image domain with deep neural networks, avoiding patch-based processing or explicit matrix decomposition.

Result: LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods on multiple public datasets in accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, achieving real-time detection at 82.34 FPS and showing resilience to sensor noise on the NoisySIRST dataset.

Conclusion: Directly learning low-rank background structures end-to-end with deep networks is effective for IR small target detection, providing superior detection performance and efficiency, and the approach will be publicly available.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

*Shuo wang,Jihao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents MF2Summ, a multimodal video summarization model integrating visual and auditory features, using advanced Transformer-based fusion and key shot selection techniques, achieving improved performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video summarization methods relying on a single modality fail to capture full semantic richness of videos, necessitating effective multimodal techniques.

Method: MF2Summ extracts visual features with GoogLeNet and auditory features with SoundNet, employs a cross-modal Transformer and alignment-guided self-attention Transformer for fusion, predicts segment importance metrics, and selects key shots using NMS and KTS algorithms.

Result: MF2Summ outperforms DSNet by improving F1 scores by 1.9% on SumMe and 0.6% on TVSum datasets, showing competitive and favorable results compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Integrating visual and auditory modalities with sophisticated fusion and selection mechanisms effectively enhances video summarization performance, as demonstrated by MF2Summ's superior results.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

### [36] [Towards Robust Multimodal Emotion Recognition under Missing Modalities and Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10452)
*Guowei Zhong,Ruohong Huan,Mingzhen Wu,Ronghua Liang,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CIDer, a robust multimodal emotion recognition framework addressing modality missing and out-of-distribution challenges with fewer parameters and faster training than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal emotion recognition methods struggle to handle missing modalities and out-of-distribution data effectively and often require complex or model-specific designs that limit practicality.

Method: CIDer includes a Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module enhancing robustness via weight-sharing self-distillation across features, and a Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) module using a causal graph and counterfactual texts to mitigate biases and improve OOD generalization. Additional components like WSAM and MCT reduce complexity and aid fusion.

Result: CIDer shows robust performance on newly repartitioned OOD MER datasets and random modality feature missing tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters and faster training.

Conclusion: CIDer effectively addresses both modality missing and OOD generalization challenges in MER, offering a practical, efficient solution with open-source implementation available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

*Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Jie Chen,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of compressing human body videos using generative video codecs by proposing an Implicit Motion Transformation (IMT) method for better reconstruction and compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human body videos have complex and diverse motion patterns that make explicit motion guidance in generative human video coding prone to distortions and inaccuracies, necessitating a better approach.

Method: The authors propose representing complex human body video signals as compact visual features and transforming these features into implicit motion guidance for improved signal reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results show that the IMT paradigm enhances generative human video coding, enabling high-efficiency compression without sacrificing synthesis fidelity.

Conclusion: Implicit Motion Transformation effectively overcomes the limitations of explicit motion-based approaches in human body video compression, achieving both efficient compression and high-quality video synthesis.

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

*Chun Liu,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zheng Zheng,Zheng Li,Wei Yang,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve transferability of adversarial attacks on hyperspectral image classification models by applying block-wise transformations and a novel feature distancing loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial attack research on hyperspectral images (HSIs) is limited and struggles to utilize their unique structural and spectral features effectively, unlike adversarial studies in natural images.

Method: The method involves dividing HSIs into spatial-spectral blocks, applying diverse transformations to increase input variety, and introducing a feature distancing loss that targets intermediate neural network layers to better disrupt true class features and enhance transferability of adversarial examples.

Result: Experiments on two public HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method generates adversarial examples with strong transferability to black-box models and maintains attack robustness against defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances adversarial example transferability for HSI classification models by leveraging block-wise diversity and feature-level loss, addressing challenges unique to hyperspectral image data.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

*Stone Yun,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies the impact of weight initialization on the quantization robustness of CNNs and proposes a novel Graph Hypernetwork-based initialization method that significantly improves quantized accuracy, especially at very low bitwidths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on post-training techniques for DNN quantization robustness, but initial weight choice effects on quantization robustness are underexplored, despite known impacts on floating point model accuracy.

Method: Extensive analysis of different random weight initializations on CNN architectures, followed by development of Graph Hypernetworks (GHN) to predict quantization-robust parameters, including a fine-tuned variant GHN-QAT for quantized graphs.

Result: GHN-predicted parameters show robustness after float32 pretraining, and GHN-QAT further improves quantized accuracy notably at 4-bit and 2-bit levels, outperforming random initialization.

Conclusion: Weight initialization is critical for quantization robustness; GHN-QAT is a novel and effective approach to initialize quantized DNNs, opening pathways for streamlined quantization-aware training and improved model design.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MedSeg-R, a framework that uses multimodal large language models to generate precise segmentation masks and textual explanations from complex medical instructions. It introduces a new task, medical image reasoning segmentation, and provides a new dataset, MedSeg-QA, to support this task. Experimental results demonstrate MedSeg-R's effectiveness in accurate segmentation and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation models rely heavily on explicit human instructions and lack active reasoning to handle complex clinical questions, limiting automatic diagnosis capabilities. Recent multimodal large language models improve QA but fall short in generating precise segmentation masks for medical images.

Method: MedSeg-R framework combines two core modules: a global context understanding module that interprets images and complex medical instructions into multimodal intermediate representations, and a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these into accurate segmentation masks and textual responses. Additionally, MedSeg-QA dataset was created with 10,000+ annotated image-mask pairs and multi-turn conversations to support training and evaluation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate MedSeg-R achieves superior segmentation accuracy on multiple benchmarks while providing interpretable textual analysis of medical images, validating its reasoning and segmentation capabilities for complex clinical tasks.

Conclusion: MedSeg-R effectively integrates reasoning and segmentation to address the novel medical image reasoning segmentation task, advancing automatic medical diagnosis. The accompanying MedSeg-QA dataset facilitates further research and development in this direction.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical
images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates four vision-language models for zero-shot deepfake detection across faceswap, reenactment, and synthetic images, finding that while these models provide coherent explanations and detect basic anomalies, they are not reliable as standalone detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the applicability of advanced vision-language models in addressing the challenge posed by increasingly sophisticated deepfakes, aiming to explore their strengths and limitations in detection.

Method: Conducted a structured zero-shot evaluation using a benchmark of authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources to test classification accuracy and reasoning ability of four VLMs: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok across three deepfake types.

Result: VLMs can detect surface-level anomalies and generate coherent explanations but often fail due to overreliance on stylistic cues and susceptibility to misleading visual patterns like vintage aesthetics.

Conclusion: While not yet reliable for autonomous detection, vision-language models offer interpretability and contextual insight that can enhance human expertise within hybrid or human-in-the-loop deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

*Juan C. Martinez-Sevilla,Joan Cerveto-Serrano,Noelia Luna,Greg Chapman,Craig Sapp,David Rizo,Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset for benchmarking Optical Music Recognition (OMR), and proposes a new metric OMR-NED for detailed evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the long-standing gap in standardized OMR evaluation with a diverse dataset and a refined evaluation metric.

Method: Created the SMB dataset of 685 pages covering various musical textures encoded in Humdrum **kern format, and designed OMR-NED metric that refines Symbol Error Rate to analyze errors at fine-grained musical element level.

Result: Baseline experiments on SMB with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of SMB and OMR-NED in benchmarking and error analysis.

Conclusion: SMB and OMR-NED provide a standardized, nuanced framework for assessing OMR performance, enabling clear comparison and fostering research progress in OMR.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical
textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

*Guyang Zhang,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of identifying honey's botanical origins using class-incremental learning (CIL) on hyperspectral imaging data and proposes a continual backpropagation (CB) method to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the diversity of honey types and the impracticality of collecting all varieties at once for model training, effective techniques for botanical origin differentiation are necessary to protect consumers.

Method: The study compared multiple CIL algorithms on a real honey hyperspectral dataset and introduced a novel CB algorithm that reinitializes less-used hidden neurons to mitigate loss-of-plasticity and enhance neural network variability.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that integrating the CB method improved the performance of most CIL algorithms by 1-7%.

Conclusion: The proposed CB-enhanced CIL approach effectively improves botanical origin classification of honey, supporting better market differentiation and consumer protection.

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSLG-SAM is a two-stage framework for Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation that first localizes target objects and then segments them precisely, reducing annotation needs and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RRSIS methods require dense annotations and struggle with complex scenes, motivating a more efficient and accurate approach.

Method: The task is split into coarse localization via a visual grounding network and fine segmentation using SAM guided by clustering and mask boundary optimization, with the second stage being train-free.

Result: On two datasets, RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M, PSLG-SAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating enhanced segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: By decomposing the task and leveraging a train-free fine segmentation stage, PSLG-SAM reduces data annotation burdens and handles complex scenes better, setting a new performance benchmark in RRSIS.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: J-DDL is an automated system integrating 2D images and 3D point clouds for precise fighter aircraft surface damage detection and localization, improving inspection coverage and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual aircraft surface inspections are limited by scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to complex structures and vast surface areas, necessitating an automated, reliable detection system.

Method: J-DDL combines laser scanner and camera data to create 2D and 3D surface models. It uses a YOLO-based neural network enhanced with lightweight Fasternet blocks, Efficient Multiscale Attention modules, and a novel Inner-CIOU loss function to detect defects in 2D images, then maps these to 3D point clouds for accurate localization.

Result: The proposed system notably improves detection accuracy, efficiency, and coverage of complex aircraft surfaces. Experimental validation confirms the framework's effectiveness and the value of the new aircraft damage dataset provided.

Conclusion: J-DDL effectively automates surface damage detection and localization in fighter aircraft, enabling comprehensive inspections and paving the way for advancements in automated aircraft maintenance technology.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

Method: The paper introduces CogStream, a task simulating real-world streaming scenarios, and proposes CogReasoner, a model that uses visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval to efficiently identify key context.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CogReasoner in handling the task, validating the approach with the newly created, densely annotated dataset.

Conclusion: Selective context utilization is crucial for efficient and accurate streaming video reasoning, and CogReasoner provides a promising baseline for future research in this area.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

TL;DR: Introduces the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric to detect subtle demographic biases in face recognition systems by analyzing score distribution tails separately for genuine and impostor scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics often miss subtle demographic biases in face recognition systems, especially in the tails of score distributions.

Method: CEI analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately with configurable focus on tail probabilities and overall distribution shapes; CEI^A is an automated version to enhance objectivity and usability.

Result: Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art and biased face recognition models across diverse datasets show CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases that existing methods miss.

Conclusion: CEI and CEI^A provide robust, sensitive tools for operational fairness assessment in face biometrics and can be applied to other domains analyzing distribution tails.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

TL;DR: This paper presents a Diffusion Transformer-based framework to generate realistic human-product demonstration videos in e-commerce, addressing identity preservation and spatial relationship challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to maintain both human and product identities and lack spatial understanding, resulting in unrealistic and unnatural product demonstration videos.

Method: The proposed method uses paired human-product reference data, a masked cross-attention mechanism, 3D body mesh templates, product bounding boxes for motion guidance, and structured text encoding for semantic consistency.

Result: The approach outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in preserving identities and producing realistic human-product interactions in demonstration videos.

Conclusion: The Diffusion Transformer-based framework effectively generates high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos with improved identity preservation and spatial alignment, benefiting e-commerce product presentations.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

*Jun Wang,Lixing Zhu,Xiaohan Yu,Abhir Bhalerao,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLACE framework improves medical image-report learning by focusing on pathological-level alignment and exploring correlations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks without requiring extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image-report joint learning faces challenges from lengthy, complex reports and often ignores pathological-level consistency, limiting effective representation learning.

Method: PLACE introduces pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) to ensure pathology observation consistency between images and reports, uses a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor, and employs a proxy task to capture fine-grained correlation among image patches without extra annotations.

Result: The PLACE framework outperforms previous methods on various downstream tasks such as classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection, and report generation.

Conclusion: Focusing on pathological-level alignment and fine-grained correlation exploration enhances medical visual representation learning, making PLACE robust and generalizable without additional human annotations.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

### [55] [DanceChat: Large Language Model-Guided Music-to-Dance Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10574)
*Qing Wang,Xiaohang Yang,Yilan Dong,Naveen Raj Govindaraj,Gregory Slabaugh,Shanxin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DanceChat is a novel music-to-dance generation system that uses a large language model to generate textual instructions guiding dance motion, enhancing diversity and alignment with music styles compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in music-to-dance generation including the semantic gap between abstract musical cues and physical dance movements, the one-to-many mapping of music to dance, and the lack of paired data limiting diverse dance pattern learning.

Method: DanceChat uses an LLM as a choreographer generating pseudo textual motion instructions from music style and structure; it integrates music, rhythm, and textual guidance through a multi-modal feature fusion; and employs a diffusion-based motion synthesis with multi-modal alignment loss to generate dance motions aligned with music and text.

Result: Experiments on the AIST++ dataset and human evaluations demonstrate DanceChat achieves superior qualitative and quantitative performance compared to state-of-the-art music-to-dance generation methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLM-generated textual guidance enables more diverse and musically aligned dance generation, effectively overcoming prior limitations of implicit music-only conditioning and sparse paired data.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: T2I-PAL uses text-to-image generation to reduce modality gap in vision-language models, improving multi-label recognition without fully annotated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap between image and text features limits performance when leveraging text as images for fine-tuning in models like CLIP.

Method: T2I-PAL generates diverse images from text captions using pre-trained text-to-image models, incorporates class-wise heatmaps and learnable prototypes for local feature representation, and combines prompt tuning with adapter learning for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: T2I-PAL improves multi-label image recognition accuracy by 3.47% on benchmarks such as MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: T2I-PAL effectively narrows the modality gap, reduces annotation needs, and integrates seamlessly into CLIP frameworks, enhancing image recognition performance via text-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

### [57] [Harmonizing Geometry and Uncertainty: Diffusion with Hyperspheres](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10576)
*Muskan Dosi,Chiranjeev Chiranjeev,Kartik Thakral,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperSphereDiff is a diffusion model designed for hyperspherical data, using directional noise to preserve class geometry and angular uncertainty, outperforming standard isotropic Gaussian-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models apply isotropic Gaussian noise suited for Euclidean spaces, failing to capture angular geometry inherent in hyperspherical data, which leads to poor generative performance.

Method: They propose HyperSphereDiff, which utilizes directional noise aligned with hyperspherical geometry to maintain class-specific angular structures during the diffusion process.

Result: Both theoretical analysis and experiments on multiple object and face datasets show that HyperSphereDiff better preserves the class geometry of hyperspherical data and improves generative accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating angular uncertainty and respecting hyperspherical geometry in diffusion models leads to more accurate, geometry-aware generative modeling for non-Euclidean data.

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

### [58] [Rethinking Random Masking in Self Distillation on ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10582)
*Jihyeon Seong,Hyunkyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of random masking in Vision Transformers' self-distillation framework DINO, proposing an asymmetric masking approach applying it only to the student's global view, which leads to more robust attention and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking in self-distillation frameworks can remove important semantic information, potentially hindering performance. The motivation is to find a masking strategy that retains critical information while still benefiting from regularization and efficiency.

Method: They apply random masking only to the student's global view in the DINO framework, keeping the student's local views and teacher's global view unmasked to preserve clean supervision. This exploits DINO's multi-view augmentation for robustness and training efficiency.

Result: Using DINO-Tiny on mini-ImageNet, this asymmetric random masking approach produces more robust and fine-grained attention maps and improves downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Selective random masking in self-distillation frameworks like DINO can enhance model robustness and accuracy by preserving important semantic cues while maintaining regularization benefits.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

### [59] [Hierarchical Error Assessment of CAD Models for Aircraft Manufacturing-and-Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10594)
*Jin Huang,Honghua Chen,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a hierarchical framework (HEA-MM) to assess errors in aircraft CAD models using structured light scanning and multi-level deviation analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring high quality, performance, stability, and reliability in aviation equipment through precise error assessment of manufactured parts.

Method: HEA-MM captures 3D scans of workpieces, aligns them with CAD models, and conducts error analysis at global, part, and feature levels, using optimization-based primitive refinement and a two-stage circular hole detection algorithm.

Result: Experimental validation on various aircraft CAD models showed effective and accurate detection of deviations at multiple hierarchical levels.

Conclusion: The proposed HEA-MM framework provides a comprehensive and effective approach for hierarchical error assessment in aircraft manufacturing, improving quality control processes.

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

*Xinyuan Liu,Hang Xu,Yike Ma,Yucheng Zhang,Feng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents SSP, a framework for oriented object detection in dense remote sensing images using point supervision, improving sample assignment and reducing confusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for oriented object detection with point supervision are limited by rigid rule-based sample assignment and instance confusion in dense scenes.

Method: SSP integrates rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification via Pixel-level Spatial Partition for sample assignment and Semantic Spatial Partition for box extraction to generate accurate pseudo-labels.

Result: SSP achieves 45.78% mAP on DOTA-v1.0 under point supervision, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by 4.10%, and further improves mAP when combined with ORCNN and ReDet architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed SSP framework effectively enhances point-supervised oriented object detection through innovative spatial partitioning techniques, demonstrating superior performance and potential for practical remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is
available at https://github.com/antxinyuan/ssp.

*Eshan Ramesh,Nishio Takayuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatentCSI generates high-resolution images from WiFi CSI measurements using a pretrained latent diffusion model with a lightweight neural network, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve image synthesis from WiFi CSI data by avoiding computationally intensive GANs and complex image encoding stages, and to enable efficient, controllable, high-quality image generation.

Method: A lightweight neural network maps CSI amplitudes into the latent space of a pretrained LDM, which then applies denoising diffusion with text guidance before decoding to produce high-resolution images.

Result: LatentCSI outperforms comparable baseline models in computational efficiency and perceptual image quality on both a custom wide-band CSI dataset and the MM-Fi dataset, with added benefit of text-guided image controllability.

Conclusion: LatentCSI offers an efficient, effective, and controllable approach to synthesizing physical environment images from WiFi CSI data, surpassing prior methods in performance and practical usability.

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

*Liang Yin,Xudong Xie,Zhang Li,Xiang Bai,Yuliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MSTAR, a box-free method for multi-query scene text retrieval that eliminates the need for bounding box annotations and unifies various query types, achieving superior performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene text retrieval methods require costly bounding box annotations and often struggle to unify diverse query types for retrieval, limiting their applicability and efficiency.

Method: The authors introduce MSTAR, which uses progressive vision embedding for multi-grained text representation, style-aware instructions to harmonize free-style text queries, and a multi-instance matching module to improve vision-language alignment. They also provide a new Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset to evaluate models.

Result: MSTAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches by 6.4% MAP on Total-Text and outperforms previous models by 8.5% on the MQTR dataset. It also eliminates the need for bounding box annotations, reducing training costs.

Conclusion: MSTAR effectively unifies multi-query scene text retrieval without bounding box annotations, demonstrating superior performance and providing a new benchmark dataset, making it a significant advancement in scene text retrieval.

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

### [63] [TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10612)
*Suin Lee,Dae-Shik Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TexTailor is a new method that generates consistent object textures from text by improving diffusion model integration and adaptively adjusting camera views based on object geometry, overcoming limitations of previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-texture synthesis methods produce inconsistent textures across viewpoints due to poor integration of previously synthesized textures and fixed camera positions that ignore object geometry, leading to degraded texture quality.

Method: TexTailor uses a resampling scheme to repeatedly integrate synthesized textures during diffusion, fine-tunes a depth-aware diffusion model with a performance preservation loss to maintain image fidelity, and adaptively adjusts camera positions based on object geometry for better texture consistency.

Result: Experiments on Objaverse and ShapeNet datasets show TexTailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating view-consistent textures.

Conclusion: By integrating texture information more effectively during synthesis and customizing camera viewpoints to object geometry, TexTailor significantly improves the consistency and quality of text-generated object textures.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

*Konstantinos Vilouras,Ilias Stogiannidis,Junyu Yan,Alison Q. O'Neil,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of applying text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models to medical imaging, specifically chest X-rays, by improving alignment between radiology reports and scans through fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models have excelled in natural image tasks but are underutilized in medical imaging due to data scarcity and poor alignment between clinical text and images. Enhancing this alignment can enable effective downstream diagnostic tasks.

Method: The authors first identify misalignment between text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Models and chest X-ray scans. They then propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a pre-trained model, allowing it to be repurposed for tasks like phrase grounding.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MS-CXR benchmark and shows robust generalization on out-of-distribution data such as VinDr-CXR.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning Latent Diffusion Models to better align clinical text with corresponding X-ray regions improves performance in medical imaging tasks, demonstrating the potential of text-to-image models in this domain.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: SymmFlow is a unified model framework for semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation using symmetrical flow matching, achieving state-of-the-art results and efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified model that integrates semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation while ensuring bi-directional consistency and generative diversity.

Method: SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly with a symmetric learning objective and introduces a new training objective to retain semantic information and allow efficient one-step semantic segmentation and classification.

Result: SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art semantic image synthesis with low FID scores on CelebAMask-HQ and COCO-Stuff using only 25 inference steps, delivers competitive segmentation results, and shows promising classification performance.

Conclusion: SymmFlow effectively unifies multiple vision tasks under a single model with efficient inference, flexible conditioning, and competitive or superior performance across tasks.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GigaVideo-1 is a fine-tuning framework for video diffusion models that improves video generation quality efficiently without human supervision by using prompt-driven data generation and reward-guided optimization based on feedback from vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance video generation quality in diffusion models across multiple dimensions without relying on costly human annotations and large computational resources.

Method: GigaVideo-1 uses a prompt-driven data engine to create diverse training samples targeting model weaknesses, and a reward-guided training strategy that weights samples adaptively with feedback from pre-trained vision-language models under realism constraints.

Result: GigaVideo-1 improved video generation performance by about 4% on average across 17 evaluation metrics on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using only 4 GPU-hours of fine-tuning with no manual annotation and minimal real data.

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1 effectively and efficiently advances video generation quality by unlocking latent potential of pre-trained diffusion models without additional human supervision, making it a practical fine-tuning approach.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PiPViT is a prototype-based, interpretable image recognition model leveraging vision transformers to learn robust, clinically relevant lesion prototypes from image-level labels, achieving competitive performance on retinal OCT classification and providing meaningful biomarker localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prototype-based methods in medical imaging yield prototypes that are too granular and not always consistent with human-understandable biomarkers, limiting interpretability and clinical applicability especially regarding lesion extent.

Method: PiPViT uses a vision transformer to capture long-range patch dependencies, employs contrastive learning and multi-resolution inputs to learn robust, interpretable prototypes that approximate lesion extent using only image-level labels, enabling effective biomarker localization.

Result: PiPViT demonstrated competitive classification accuracy on four retinal OCT datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods, with prototypes that are semantically and clinically relevant, validated by quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set.

Conclusion: PiPViT provides transparent, clinically meaningful explanations for diagnostic decisions, potentially aiding clinicians in understanding and trusting automated medical image classification outputs.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight CNN with SE blocks for effective deepfake detection, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes pose significant threats to information authenticity, and current detection models are large and resource-heavy, necessitating a lightweight yet effective solution.

Method: A lightweight convolutional neural network is designed incorporating squeeze and excitation block attention to recalibrate features dynamically, emphasizing informative channels while suppressing less useful ones.

Result: The proposed model attains 94.14% accuracy and a 0.985 AUC-ROC score on the Style GAN dataset, comparable to existing larger models but with less storage and memory usage.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising, efficient, and scalable solution for deepfake detection, suitable for deployment with minimal computational resources.

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

*Xia Du,Xiaoyuan Liu,Jizhe Zhou,Zheng Lin,Chi-man Pun,Zhe Chen,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a method using LLMs and diffusion models to create high-quality, diverse adversarial CAPTCHAs that successfully fool deep neural networks while remaining human-interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHA methods are increasingly vulnerable to deep learning attacks, and current adversarial attacks distort images or depend on existing images, limiting their usability.

Method: UAC uses attacker-specified text prompts with an LLM to generate diverse adversarial CAPTCHAs. For targeted attacks, it employs the EDICT method to optimize latent variables in diffusion models. For untargeted, especially black-box attacks, it introduces BP-UAC, a two-step optimization using multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization.

Result: BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates on diverse CAPTCHA systems, producing natural-looking CAPTCHAs that are indistinguishable to both humans and DNNs.

Conclusion: UAC effectively generates adversarial CAPTCHAs that bypass DNN-based recognition without compromising human readability, enhancing vulnerability exploitation against modern CAPTCHA defenses.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

### [70] [Underage Detection through a Multi-Task and MultiAge Approach for Screening Minors in Unconstrained Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10689)
*Christopher Gaul,Eduardo Fidalgo,Enrique Alegre,Rocío Alaiz Rodríguez,Eri Pérez Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-task model with a vision-language backbone and specialized loss functions to improve minor age screening in images, handling class imbalance and distribution shifts. It introduces a new benchmark with diverse test sets and shows improved age estimation and under-age detection performance, especially under real-world shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately screen minors in unconstrained images despite data imbalance and distribution shifts, improving legal age discrimination robustness where children are underrepresented in data.

Method: A multi-task architecture combining a frozen vision-language backbone with a two-layer MLP, multiple age discrimination heads for critical age thresholds, an alpha-reweighted focal loss, age-balanced mini-batch sampling, and an age gap loss to remove edge cases. New benchmarks were created with cleaned large-scale datasets and tests for challenging conditions.

Result: The proposed model outperforms age-only baselines by reducing root-mean-square-error in age estimation and significantly improving under-age detection F2 scores across multiple age thresholds. It maintains high recall and robust performance even under wild domain shifts involving pose, expression, and image quality variations.

Conclusion: The multi-task approach with loss reweighting and specialized benchmarks effectively enhances minor age screening performance, demonstrating resilience to class imbalance and distribution shifts in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

*Melika Ayoughi,Mina Ghadimi Atigh,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Cees G. M. Snoek,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the task of continual learning of both instances and classes simultaneously, proposing a novel algorithm HyperCLIC that models hierarchical relationships using hyperbolic space to enhance hierarchical generalization in real-world scenarios like robotics and self-driving cars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require models to classify instances and classes together, adapting to multiple levels of granularity which traditional continual learning approaches do not address.

Method: HyperCLIC leverages hyperbolic space to model hierarchical relationships between classes and instances, incorporating hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives to embed these relations continually.

Result: The approach is validated on the EgoObjects dataset, showing improved hierarchical generalization and effective operation across multiple granularities in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: HyperCLIC effectively models hierarchical structures in continual learning, enhancing the ability to generalize over both classes and instances simultaneously in real-world applications.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

### [72] [Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion for Camouflaged Object Detection Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10712)
*Yuqi Shen,Fengyang Xiao,Sujie Hu,Youwei Pang,Yifan Pu,Chengyu Fang,Xiu Li,Chunming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes UMBD, a novel generative refinement framework for Camouflaged Object Detection, using uncertainty-guided Bernoulli diffusion to improve segmentation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current COD methods lack effective post-processing refinement to handle subtle differences between objects and backgrounds.

Method: UMBD applies Bernoulli diffusion selectively on uncertain regions identified by a Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network (HUQNet), which fuses multi-source uncertainty for accurate guidance.

Result: UMBD improves existing COD models across benchmarks by 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with minor added computation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances COD segmentation by combining discriminative models with generative diffusion refinement, demonstrating practical benefits for challenging visual contexts.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

*Emílio Dolgener Cantú,Rolf Klemens Wittmann,Oliver Abdeen,Patrick Wagner,Wojciech Samek,Moritz Baier,Sebastian Lapuschkin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning method to generate synthetic golden standard images for Indium-Phosphide wafer manufacturing defect detection, overcoming the lack of real golden standards and improving over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low production scale and high design variability in InP wafer manufacturing make obtaining golden standard images difficult, resulting in manual, labor-intensive defect detection.

Method: Use Deep Neural Networks trained on CAD data to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images, evaluating multiple training objectives and comparing to baseline methods.

Result: The deep learning approach outperforms decision-tree-based methods and generates synthetic golden dies usable in any wafer region.

Conclusion: The method enables more efficient, automated defect detection by providing high-quality synthetic golden standards, demonstrated in practical template matching for surface defect detection.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

*Hong Huang,Weixiang Sun,Zhijian Wu,Jingwen Niu,Donghuan Lu,Xian Wu,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes IQE-CLIP, a framework for zero- and few-shot anomaly detection in medical images, integrating textual and visual cues with learnable prompts and instance-aware queries to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based anomaly detection methods rely on predefined text prompts and prior category knowledge, struggle to differentiate normal and anomalous cases in joint embedding space, and are mostly focused on industrial tasks rather than medical applications.

Method: IQE-CLIP introduces class-based and learnable prompting tokens to adapt CLIP to medical data, along with an instance-aware query module that captures region-level visual and textual contextual information to generate anomaly-sensitive embeddings.

Result: Experimental evaluation on six medical datasets shows that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot and few-shot anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Integrating textual and instance-aware visual information through learnable prompts and instance-aware queries improves anomaly detection in medical images, addressing prior limitations and advancing ZFSAD in the medical domain.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PosterCraft is a novel framework for generating aesthetic posters that improves text rendering, layout coherence, and visual appeal through a multi-stage training process using large-scale datasets and reinforcement learning, surpassing open-source baselines and nearing commercial system quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating posters requires integrating precise text rendering with artistic content and harmonious layouts, a task more complex than simple image design, demanding a new unified approach.

Method: PosterCraft uses a cascaded workflow with four stages: optimizing text rendering using Text-Render-2M dataset, region-aware fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K, aesthetic-text reinforcement learning with preference optimization, and joint vision-language feedback refinement, supported by automated data pipelines.

Result: PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in terms of rendering accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art commercial systems.

Conclusion: The proposed PosterCraft framework successfully generates high-quality, aesthetically pleasing posters without relying on rigid layouts or modular pipelines, demonstrating the effectiveness of its multi-stage training and automated data construction approach.

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), a unified model for ultra-large image super-resolution that preserves detail and eliminates artifacts even at extreme upscaling factors like 100x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution methods degrade significantly beyond their training upscaling range, producing blurring and artifacts.

Method: SbCA decomposes images into vector graphic strokes and uses an iterative cyclic strategy with a detail completion module, trained once for all scales, to refine and restore image details progressively within the training range.

Result: SbCA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets, especially for ultra-large upsampling tasks, achieving superior visual quality at upscaling factors up to 100x.

Conclusion: The proposed SbCA model effectively solves distribution drift and detail loss issues in ultra-large image super-resolution, providing high-fidelity, artifact-free images with a single unified model.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SlotPi, a physics-informed, object-centric model that integrates Hamiltonian-based physical principles with spatio-temporal prediction to improve dynamic reasoning in scenarios involving objects and fluids. SlotPi demonstrates strong performance and adaptability in prediction and visual question answering tasks on various datasets, including a new real-world dataset with fluid-object interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object-centric dynamic simulation methods lack incorporation of physical knowledge and validation across diverse real-world scenarios, especially those involving fluids and their interactions with objects. The motivation is to bridge these gaps to better emulate human-like physical reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes SlotPi, a slot-based model combining a Hamiltonian physics module with a spatio-temporal prediction module for forecasting dynamics. This integration allows modeling both object interactions and fluid flow characteristics.

Result: Experiments show SlotPi's effectiveness in prediction and visual question answering tasks on benchmark datasets and a newly created real-world dataset involving fluid-object interactions. The model exhibited strong adaptability across different dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: SlotPi's robust performance across multiple datasets demonstrates its potential for advanced world modeling by embedding physical principles into object-centric reasoning, facilitating improved understanding and reasoning about complex dynamic phenomena.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Motivation: Conventional image-based controllers suffer from fixed processing rates, motion blur, and latency, limiting real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance performance.

Method: The approach combines asynchronous event camera data with additional range sensors, employing Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient reinforced by an initial imitation learning phase to optimize navigation policies.

Result: Simulated environment tests show robust navigation capabilities, including pedestrian following and obstacle avoidance, outperforming traditional image-based methods.

Conclusion: Integrating event-based perception with reinforcement learning enables real-time, adaptive, and effective robot navigation and obstacle avoidance, demonstrating potential for improved human-centered robotic systems.

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event

cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Prompts-to-Summaries, a zero-shot, text-queryable video summarization method using pretrained video-language and large language models without training data, outperforming existing unsupervised methods and matching supervised ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video summarization methods depend on domain-specific datasets limiting their generalizability or cannot incorporate natural language user intent, highlighting the need for a data-free, flexible, user-controllable summarization approach.

Method: The approach segments videos into scenes, uses a batch-style prompting of video-language models for scene descriptions, employs large language models to assign importance scores, and propagates these scores to frame-level via novel metrics for temporal coherency and novelty, enabling fine-grained summarization without training data.

Result: On benchmarks like SumMe, TVSum, and QFVS, the method outperforms all prior unsupervised approaches and performs competitively against supervised methods; it also introduces a new challenging dataset VidSum-Reason for query-driven summarization, demonstrating robust performance.

Conclusion: Pretrained multimodal models combined with principled prompting and score propagation offer a powerful, universal foundation for zero-shot, text-queryable video summarization, removing the reliance on supervised training data and enabling flexible user-driven video skimming.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

TL;DR: SmoothProper is a neural module that enhances unsupervised deformable image registration by enforcing smoothness and message passing during neural network forward passes, effectively handling aperture and large-displacement challenges in retinal vessel images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based deformable image registration methods struggle with images that have sparse features and large smooth areas, such as retinal vessels, due to aperture and large-displacement problems, as neural networks predict deformation fields in a single pass without strong constraints after training, relying only on network weights for regularization.

Method: The paper introduces SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module that integrates a duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms to enforce smoothness, promote message passing within the forward pass, propagate flow signals spatially, and preserve structural consistency. The module is model-agnostic, easily integrates into existing frameworks, and removes the need for tuning regularization hyperparameters.

Result: Preliminary experiments on a retinal vessel dataset with aperture and large-displacement challenges demonstrate that SmoothProper reduces registration error to 1.88 pixels on very high-resolution images (2912x2912), marking the first unsupervised DIR method to effectively handle both challenges.

Conclusion: SmoothProper advances unsupervised deformable image registration by providing a generalizable, efficient, and accurate approach to address aperture and large displacement problems without increasing model complexity or requiring additional hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents HOMAE, a method using masked autoencoders with a target-focused masking strategy and multi-scale feature integration to improve occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with occlusions in hand-object interactions due to insufficient global structural perception and reasoning capabilities.

Method: HOMAE employs masked autoencoders with a target-focused masking strategy to learn context-aware features for occluded regions. It integrates multi-scale features to predict signed distance fields (SDF) and fuses them with point clouds derived from the SDF to combine global context with precise local geometry.

Result: Experiments on DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks show that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object pose estimation, effectively handling occluded interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed HOMAE method successfully advances occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation by leveraging masked autoencoders and SDF-point cloud fusion, providing robust and accurate predictions on challenging datasets.

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

TL;DR: VideoDeepResearch is a novel agentic framework that uses a text-only large reasoning model combined with modular multi-modal tools to improve long video understanding. It outperforms existing multi-modal large language model baselines on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal large language models struggle with long video understanding due to complexity and context limitations. It is believed that advanced foundation models with extended context and strong visual skills are needed.

Method: The approach uses a text-only large reasoning model together with modular multi-modal retrievers and perceivers, forming problem-solving strategies that selectively access relevant video content via tool usage.

Result: VideoDeepResearch significantly outperforms existing MLLM baselines on multiple long video understanding benchmarks, improving scores by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU, LVBench, and LongVideoBench respectively.

Conclusion: Agentic systems combining reasoning models with modular multi-modal tools are effective in overcoming challenges in long video understanding, offering a promising direction beyond reliance on large unified multi-modal models.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

### [83] [Post-Training Quantization for Video Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10840)
*Tianrui Zhu,Houyuan Chen,Ruihao Gong,Michele Magno,Haotong Qin,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) framework for video matting models aimed at maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence on resource-constrained devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video matting is vital for film production and VR but deploying heavy models on devices with limited resources is challenging due to computational demands. Existing PTQ methods struggle with accuracy and temporal coherence in video matting.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage PTQ strategy combining block-reconstruction-based optimization and global calibration of quantization parameters. They introduce a Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) to correct statistical distortions and an Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) module to leverage temporal and semantic priors for better handling of moving foregrounds.

Result: Their PTQ4VM approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across varying bit-widths, reducing errors by up to 20% compared to existing PTQ methods. Notably, the 4-bit quantized model approaches full-precision performance while providing eightfold FLOP savings.

Conclusion: The proposed PTQ4VM effectively compresses video matting models for deployment on constrained devices without significant loss in accuracy or temporal coherence, enabling practical, efficient video matting applications at ultra-low-bit quantization.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRBench is a comprehensive benchmark featuring long narrative videos and multi-step reasoning questions to test large models' abilities in temporal and procedural reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations lack consideration of temporal reasoning and procedural validity in multi-step reasoning for large models.

Method: VRBench includes 1,010 long videos with annotated multi-step QA pairs and reasoning steps, curated through expert review for plot coherence. It uses a human-AI collaborative framework to generate reasoning chains across seven reasoning types, and a multi-phase evaluation pipeline with MCQs and a novel LLM-guided scoring metric for process-level assessment.

Result: Evaluation of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on VRBench provides deep analysis and insights into the models' multi-step reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: VRBench offers a valuable resource and evaluation framework to advance understanding and development of multi-step reasoning in large models, focusing on temporal and procedural correctness.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

*Zhao Zhang,Yutao Cheng,Dexiang Hong,Maoke Yang,Gonglei Shi,Lei Ma,Hui Zhang,Jie Shao,Xinglong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CreatiPoster is a new AI framework that generates editable, multi-layer graphic designs using natural language or assets, outperforming existing systems and aiming to democratize AI-assisted graphic design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphic design is essential but complex and skill-intensive, especially for beginners; existing AI tools either partially automate the process or lack in editability and professional quality, while commercial systems depend on impractical large template libraries.

Method: CreatiPoster uses a protocol model (RGBA large multimodal model) to create a detailed JSON specification of each layer including layout, content, and style from user inputs; then a conditional background model synthesizes a coherent background based on the rendered foreground layers.

Result: CreatiPoster outperforms top open-source and commercial graphic design AI tools according to a newly constructed benchmark with automated metrics; it also supports varied applications like canvas editing, responsive resizing, and multilingual adaptation.

Conclusion: The framework advances AI-assisted graphic design by producing editable, high-quality multi-layer compositions and provides a large copyright-free dataset to foster future research in this area.

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

### [86] [AIR: Zero-shot Generative Model Adaptation with Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10895)
*Guimeng Liu,Milad Abdollahzadeh,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM), focusing on the misalignment between image and text offsets in CLIP embedding space, and proposes a novel method AIR to improve image quality in the target domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSGM methods assume perfect alignment between image and text offsets in CLIP embedding space, leading to degraded image quality due to offset misalignment correlated with concept distance.

Method: The authors perform an empirical study of offset misalignment and propose a novel method called Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR) to tackle the misalignment issue and improve generated image quality in zero-shot settings.

Result: AIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in 26 experimental setups across qualitative, quantitative, and user study evaluations, demonstrating significant improvements in image quality.

Conclusion: By incorporating insights on offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space, AIR advances zero-shot generative model adaptation by enhancing target domain image quality, overcoming limitations of prior directional loss-based approaches.

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

*Jiancheng Huang,Gengwei Zhang,Zequn Jie,Siyu Jiao,Yinlong Qian,Ling Chen,Yunchao Wei,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M4V introduces an efficient text-to-video generation framework using a novel Multi-Modal Mamba architecture that reduces computational cost and enhances video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video generation is computationally intensive due to the quadratic complexity of Transformers, limiting practical application, especially for high-resolution videos and multi-modal inputs.

Method: The paper proposes M4V, which integrates multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) blocks with a novel token re-composition design for spatiotemporal and multi-modal modeling, reducing FLOPs by 45%. Additionally, a reward learning strategy improves visual quality in long-context generation.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks show that M4V generates high-resolution, high-quality videos with significantly lower computational costs compared to attention-based methods.

Conclusion: M4V effectively addresses computational challenges in text-to-video generation, enabling efficient, high-quality video creation, and is made publicly available for further research and application.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a video-based approach to in-context image editing, employing a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on multimodal sequences extracted from videos. The model outperforms existing methods and handles multi-turn editing, story generation, and compositional tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an in-context image editing model without relying on task-specific pipelines and expert annotations by leveraging videos as a training source.

Method: Annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences and train a block-causal diffusion transformer on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction. A new multi-turn image editing benchmark is also introduced.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks, demonstrating strong editing capabilities despite being trained solely on videos. It also performs well in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.

Conclusion: Video-based training of a diffusion transformer enables effective in-context image editing, providing a scalable alternative to expert-dependent methods and advancing multi-turn editing research.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

*Yuanhui Huang,Weiliang Chen,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpectralAR, a spectral-based autoregressive visual generation framework that models visual sequences causally from low to high frequency components, achieving efficient and effective image reconstruction and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual autoregressive methods use spatial patches, which contradict the causal nature of autoregressive modeling because image patches are parallel. The motivation is to impose true causality in visual sequence generation.

Method: The paper proposes Nested Spectral Tokenization to transform images into ordered spectral tokens from low to high frequency, enabling autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine sequence.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, SpectralAR achieves a 3.02 gFID score using only 64 tokens and 310M parameters, demonstrating strong performance in image reconstruction and generation.

Conclusion: SpectralAR effectively enforces causality in visual sequence generation via spectral decomposition, achieving token efficiency and competitive generation quality without complex enhancements.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

*Yuxuan Luo,Yuhui Yuan,Junwen Chen,Haonan Cai,Ziyi Yue,Yuwei Yang,Fatima Zohra Daha,Ji Li,Zhouhui Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces knowledge image generation and a new benchmark (MMMG) for evaluating image generation models' reasoning abilities, presenting significant shortcomings in current models and an effective baseline solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge images play a crucial role in human learning and understanding, but generating such images requires complex multimodal reasoning that current models lack. There's a need for a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation metric to assess and improve these capabilities.

Method: The authors propose MMMG, a large-scale benchmark with expert-validated knowledge image-prompt pairs across various disciplines and educational levels, using a unified Knowledge Graph representation to standardize evaluation. They also develop MMMG-Score, combining factual fidelity and visual clarity metrics, and introduce FLUX-Reason, a baseline combining reasoning LLM with diffusion models trained on curated data.

Result: Evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image models revealed serious deficits in reasoning, with low entity fidelity and poor relation depiction; GPT-4o scored 50.20 on MMMG-Score. The baseline FLUX-Reason achieved 34.45, showing promise but also underscoring the task's difficulty.

Conclusion: Knowledge image generation is a challenging problem requiring advanced reasoning beyond current models' capabilities. The MMMG benchmark and score provide a rigorous testbed to identify weaknesses and foster development of more effective approaches like FLUX-Reason.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

*Qizhe Zhang,Mengzhen Liu,Lichen Li,Ming Lu,Yuan Zhang,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CDPruner is a novel visual token pruning method for multimodal large language models that reduces inference cost by selecting a diverse subset of tokens based on instruction-conditioned similarity, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual token pruning methods for MLLMs either retain many redundant tokens or ignore instruction relevance, leading to suboptimal performance and high inference costs.

Method: CDPruner defines conditional similarity between visual tokens based on instructions and uses determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize conditional diversity when pruning tokens, without requiring training and being model-agnostic.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDPruner outperforms existing methods on vision-language benchmarks, drastically reducing FLOPs and latency (95% and 78%) while maintaining 94% of original accuracy when applied to LLaVA.

Conclusion: Maximizing conditional diversity via DPP enables efficient and effective visual token pruning that preserves model performance under high reduction ratios, providing a practical solution for optimizing multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: GenWorld is a large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for detecting AI-generated videos by simulating real-world scenarios with diverse, realistic forgeries. The paper introduces SpannDetector, a model leveraging multi-view consistency to effectively detect high-quality AI-generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The credibility of real-world information is threatened by advanced AI-generated videos, but existing video detectors lack high-quality real-world datasets, limiting detector development and effectiveness.

Method: GenWorld dataset is created with multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to simulate realistic real-world videos with diversity across prompt modalities, and SpannDetector is proposed to use multi-view consistency as a criterion for detection.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SpannDetector outperforms existing methods in detecting high-quality AI-generated videos, especially those produced by world models like Cosmos, which prior methods fail to detect.

Conclusion: GenWorld and SpannDetector together offer a promising approach for explainable and robust AI-generated video detection based on physical plausibility, advancing the development of trustworthy detectors.

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

*Sicheng Zuo,Wenzhao Zheng,Xiaoyong Han,Longchao Yang,Yong Pan,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for efficient 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, which outperforms existing methods by using fewer, more expressive shape primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D occupancy prediction methods rely on dense voxel grids or sparse ellipsoidal Gaussians that are inefficient and insufficiently expressive for diverse object geometries in real-world driving scenes.

Method: The authors introduce a probabilistic superquadric mixture model interpreting superquadrics as occupancy probability distributions, enabling efficient modeling of complex shapes. They develop QuadricFormer integrating this model with a pruning-and-splitting module to focus representation on occupied regions.

Result: QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset with higher efficiency compared to prior dense voxel or ellipsoid-based methods.

Conclusion: Using geometrically expressive superquadrics as primitives allows more efficient and accurate 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, improving perception quality while reducing computational cost.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

### [94] [Fine-Grained Perturbation Guidance via Attention Head Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10978)
*Donghoon Ahn,Jiwon Kang,Sanghyun Lee,Minjae Kim,Jaewon Min,Wooseok Jang,Saungwu Lee,Sayak Paul,Susung Hong,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents 'HeadHunter', a novel framework for fine-grained control in diffusion model generation by targeting individual attention heads in Diffusion Transformer architectures, improving visual quality and enabling style-specific guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention perturbation methods in diffusion models lack principled approaches to select where perturbations should be applied, especially in DiT architectures where computations are spread across layers.

Method: The authors analyze attention perturbation granularity from layer-level to individual heads, discovering heads correspond to distinct visual concepts. They propose 'HeadHunter' to iteratively select heads aligned with user goals and 'SoftPAG' to continuously tune perturbation strength by interpolating attention maps toward identity matrices.

Result: Their method reduces oversmoothing of layer-level perturbations, allows targeted manipulation of visual styles by compositional head selection, and shows superior quality enhancement and style guidance performance in large-scale DiT-based models like Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1.

Conclusion: The study provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, revealing interpretable specialization of attention heads and enabling effective, practical perturbation strategies for controlled generation quality and styles.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

*Junqi You,Chieh Hubert Lin,Weijie Lyu,Zhengbo Zhang,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaInpaint is a fast, reference-based 3D scene inpainting method that operates in real-time (0.4s), greatly speeding up previous approaches by 1000x while maintaining state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene inpainting approaches are too slow and computationally expensive for real-time or online use, which limits their practical application in interactive VR/AR scenarios.

Method: The authors propose InstaInpaint, a feed-forward framework leveraging a self-supervised masked-finetuning training strategy on a large dataset to train a large reconstruction model (LRM), using 2D inpainting proposals as references for 3D scene completion.

Result: InstaInpaint achieves a 1000x speed improvement compared to prior methods, maintains state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks, and exhibits strong generalization to downstream tasks like object insertion and multi-region inpainting.

Conclusion: InstaInpaint enables practical real-time 3D scene inpainting with high quality, offering significant performance gains without sacrificing accuracy, facilitating interactive VR/AR applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

### [96] [SceneCompleter: Dense 3D Scene Completion for Generative Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10981)
*Weiliang Chen,Jiayi Bi,Yuanhui Huang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneCompleter is a novel framework for 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis that improves over conventional 2D completion plus 3D recovery methods by using a dual-stream diffusion model and a scene embedder for dense 3D scene completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for novel view synthesis often produce overly smooth surfaces and distorted geometry because they infer 3D structure only from RGB data in a two-step process, leading to lack of 3D consistency.

Method: SceneCompleter employs a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model to jointly synthesize novel views in RGBD space and uses a scene embedder for holistic scene representation from reference images, effectively fusing structural and textural information for coherent 3D scene completion.

Result: The method achieves superior visual coherence and 3D-consistency in generative novel view synthesis, outperforming prior methods across multiple diverse datasets.

Conclusion: SceneCompleter provides a more plausible and coherent approach to generative novel view synthesis by integrating dense 3D scene completion through its dual-stream diffusion model and scene embedder, overcoming limitations of previous 2D completion and 3D recovery paradigms.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.
