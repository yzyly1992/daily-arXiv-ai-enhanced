Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints.

However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM\nmethods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between\nimage offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality\ndegrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by\nthe offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform\nan empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image\noffset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.\nOur important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is\ncorrelated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset\nmisalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our\nsecond contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)\nwhich is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image\nquality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,\nquantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate\nthe proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance.
